# Publishing a New Article

Want to help contribute to the Knowledge base? Write or update an article!

## üõ°Ô∏è Requirements

-   The guides must be clear and well explained for the user to understand.
-   Fact check and make sure the information you're providing is accurate.
-   Proofread for any grammatical and spelling mistakes.
-   Validate markdown and html syntax.
-   Provide proper frontmatter.
-   Use valid links and images.
-   Make sure guides are up-to-date.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Creating an Article

By following the folder and file structure, create a `.md` file under the correct section, category and sub-category. As an example, if you were to create an article that explains how to install and use a plugin in Minecraft Java, the file would be created as such: `_posts/minecraft/plugin/general/yyyy-mm-dd-plugin-name.md`. You're required to add the date at the beginning of the file name in the `YYYY-MM-DD` format. These dates are used to show when the article was last updated, so that users are aware if an article is up-to-date.

If you wish to add an alternate version of a guide for a different Minecraft edition. ensure that both titles and permalinks are exact replica of each other.

Then start writing the article in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/). Writing in Markdown is very easy to do. If you need help understanding how to do certain tasks, like creating a link, inserting an image or creating a list, look [here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

## ‚úíÔ∏è Markdown

<details>

<br>

[Markdown cheatsheet](https://markdownguide.offshoot.io/cheat-sheet/).

### Headers

Using "# Title of Article" isn't needed; the layout will automatically add the title of the article to the top of the guide. That being said, always use "## Subtitle" instead.
It is recommended to a related Github flavored emoji at the beginning of main subtitles (## or h2) to improve user friendliness (such as: `## :earth_asia: Dynmap`). A list of all Github emojis can be found in a [cheatsheet](https://github.com/ikatyang/emoji-cheat-sheet/blob/master/README.md).

### Ordered Lists (Steps)

When typing out steps using ordered lists, make sure to separate each step with a **blank line**. Otherwise, Karamdown will not generate a `<p>` tag.

### Images

If you're adding an image to the files, use a path like `content/assets/images/posts/...`.

### Blockquote

There are 4 custom blockquote, which are each used in different context:

**Note:**

Used to add additional information that does not fit in its own paragraph.

```
> hi this is blockquote
```

**Success:**

Used to signify success messages or completion.

```
{: .success}

> hi this is blockquote
```

**Warning:**

Used as a warning to avoid something.

```
{: .warning}

> hi this is blockquote
```

**Error:**

Used as a way to display common errors or issues.

```
{: .error}

> hi this is blockquote
```

### Video

[Learn how to embed a YouTube video](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/171780?hl=en)

```

<video controls preload="auto"><source
 src="https://example.com/video.webm" type="video/webm"
 src="https://example.com/video.mp4" type="video/mp4"
 /></video>

```

> If you're adding a video to the files, use a path like `/assets/videos/posts/...`.

Make sure to provide both webm and mp4. Webm are much smaller and load faster, although an MP4 file is required as not all browsers support webm format. So the MP4 is more of a fallback option if the user's browser doesn't like the webm format.

## üì¢Ô∏è Publishing

Create a pull request in this repo and title it using the following format: "New Post: `Name of Article`" or if you're editing an article, title it like "Edit: `Name of Existing Article`".

Your edit will be reviewed by our support team along with your code to check for any syntax errors.

## üèóÔ∏è Building and Testing Locally

If you're interested in learning how to build the Knowledge Base locally, maybe to ensure that your article does show up properly, just follow either methods below.

### Method 1: Running Natively

<details>

<br>

Since the Knowledge Base is powered by Jekyll, you'll need to install it [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).
While it's installing, download a copy of this repository.

Once Jekyll is fully installed, open command prompt and change directory (`cd`) to the downloaded repository. Then type and run the following command:

```

bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload --watch

```

Once you see a done message, go to http://localhost:4000/ in your preferred web browser.

</details>

### Method 2: Running With Docker

<details>

<br>

Since we will be using Docker, you'll need to install it [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
While it's installing, download a copy of this repository, and create a `docker-compose.yml` file in it's root with the following content:

```

services:
jekyll:
volumes: - "./:/srv/jekyll" - "./vendor/bundle:/usr/local/bundle"
ports: - "4000:4000" - "35729:35729"
image: jekyll/jekyll
command: jekyll serve --livereload --watch --force_polling

```

> If this is the first time running the Knowledge Base, use `bundle install` instead of `jekyll serve --livereload --watch --force_polling`. Once everything is installed you may continue using `jekyll serve --livereload --watch --force_polling`.

Once Docker is fully installed, run it. Then open command prompt and change directory (`cd`) to the downloaded repository, and type and run the following command:

```

docker-compose up

```

Once you see a done message, go to http://localhost:4000/ in your preferred web browser.
