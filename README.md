## Publishing a New Article

Want to help contribute to the Knowledge base? Write or update an article!

## üõ°Ô∏è Requirements

- The guides must be clear and well explained for the user to understand.
- Fact check and make sure the information you're providing is accurate.
- Proofread for any grammatical and spelling mistakes.
- Validate markdown and html syntax.
- Provide proper frontmatter.
- Use valid links and images.
- Make sure guides are up-to-date.

## üìÇ Folder Structure

<details>

- The `_drafts` folder is where all previous articles from the old help center are stored. They only serve as a references and should be deleted once the article is re-created.
- The `content` folder is where all the content is hosted, any files changed here will automatically be pushed to the knowledge base.
  - `_categories` is where all the categories (such as Dashboard and Java) are stored, each grouped within its own section folder (e.g: Falix, Minecraft).
  - `_posts` is where all the articles are stored. The folder structure begins with the section (e.g: Falix, Minecraft) and then category (e.g: Dashboard, Java) and finally subcategory (e.g: General).

</details>

## ‚úçÔ∏è Creating an Article

When creating an article, create a `.md` file under the correct section, category and sub-category folders. As an example, if you were to create an article that explains how to install and use a plugin in Minecraft Java, the file would be created as such: `content/_posts/minecraft/modification/plugins/yyyy-mm-dd-plugin-name.md`. You're required to add the date at the beginning of the file name in the `YYYY-MM-DD` format. These dates are used to show when the article was last updated, so that users are aware if an article is up-to-date.

Articles are written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/). Writing in Markdown is very easy to do. If you need help understanding how to do certain tasks, like creating a link, inserting an image or creating a list, look [here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

If you wish to add an alternate version of a guide for a different Minecraft edition (Java or Bedrock). Use a replica of the other title and permalink with the corresponding category (Java or Bedrock) switched.

## üìÉÔ∏è Frontmatter

<details>

The frontmatter is the block at the top of every article surrounded by a pair of triple dashes `---`. As the frontmatter is based on YAML, ensure that the correct syntax is followed:

### Default Options

## ‚úíÔ∏è Markdown

<details>

[Markdown cheatsheet](https://markdownguide.offshoot.io/cheat-sheet/).

### Headers

Using "# Title of Article" isn't needed; the layout will automatically add the title of the article to the top of the guide. That being said, always use "## Subtitle" instead.

### Icons

We have a built in recommended icon and a few server software icons you can use anywhere in your article, we suggest using them in tabs as much as possible.

To display a recommended icon, use the code below:

```html
<i class="recommended"></i>
```

To display a server software icon, use the code below while replacing the classes with any supported class as is listed underneath it:

```html
<i class="software software-name"></i>
```

Replace `software` with either `java-software`, `bedrock-software` or `type-software` (mod, plugin, datapack).
Replace `software-name` with any supported software:

- Java: `java`, `snapshot`, `spigot`, `paper`, `pufferfish`, `purpur`, `fabric`, `neoforge`, `forge`, `quilt`, `sponge`, `mohist`, `magma`, `arclight`, `velocity`, `bungeecord`
- Bedrock: `bedrock`, `preview`, `pmmp`, `nukkit`
- Type: `mod`, `plugin`, `datapack`

### Images

If you're adding an image to the files, follow the structure below:

```markdown
![Alt text](content/assets/images/posts/...)
```

Replace `Alt text` with alternative text in case the image is not loaded properly or for accessibility purposes. `...` must also be replaced with the actual path of your image, including the file name and extension.

### Lists

When typing out steps using lists, make sure to separate each step with a **blank line**. Otherwise, a `<p>` tag will not be generated.

### Colored Text

When navigating around the Dashboard, four colors (Orange, Green, Red, Blue) can often be seen on different buttons such as Restart, Save File, Delete, Connect, etc. It is a good idea to color these words with the same color as can be seen in the Dashboard to make the guides more user friendly and vibrant. This can be done by making the word **bold** (`** **`) and immediately following it with an inline attribute with the color as a style name:

```css
**Connect**{: .blue } **Delete**{: .red } **Restart**{: .orange } **Save File**{: .green }
```

### Tabs

In certain articles, you may want to use tabs to group separate alternate procedures in one place, such as procedures on configuring a software with a plugin and mod version:

```css
{% tabs software %}

{% tab software plugin %}

Steps for the plugin go here

{% endtab %}

{% tab software mod %}

Steps for the mod go here

{% endtab %}

{% endtabs %}

```

The first word after the tab keyword is used to group the tabs together, while the words after will be displayed as the tab label. If the content of tabs have a similar structure, place the tabs under each heading rather than placing headings in tabs.
To add icons, simply paste the code before or after the tab label (e.g: `{% tab software Paper <i class="recommended"></i> %}`).

### Blockquote

There are 4 custom blockquotes, which are each used in different context:

**Note:**

Used to add additional information that does not fit in its own paragraph.

```Markdown
> hi this is blockquote
```

**Success:**

Used to signify success messages or completion.

```Markdown
{: .success}

> hi this is blockquote
```

**Warning:**

Used as a warning to avoid something.

```Markdown
{: .warning}

> hi this is blockquote
```

**Error:**

Used as a way to display common errors or issues.

```Markdown
{: .error}

> hi this is blockquote
```

### Video

[Learn how to embed a YouTube video](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/171780?hl=en)

```html
<video controls preload="auto"><source src="https://example.com/video.webm" type="video/webm" src="https://example.com/video.mp4" type="video/mp4" /></video>
```

> If you're adding a video to the files, use a path like `content/assets/videos/posts/...`.

Make sure to provide both WebM and MP4. WebM videos are much smaller and load faster, although an MP4 is required too because not all browsers support the WebM format. So, the MP4 is more of a fallback option if the user's browser doesn't like WebM.
