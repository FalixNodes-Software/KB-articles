## Introduction
The Support Center is where you go when you need help from the Falix team. Whether you're dealing with a technical issue, a billing question, or want to report a problem, the ticketing system lets you create a detailed request and communicate directly with support staff until it's resolved.

## Getting There
1. Log in to the [Falix Client Area](https://client.falixnodes.net/).
2. In the left sidebar, expand the **Support** section.
3. Click **My Tickets** to view your existing tickets, or **Open Ticket** to create a new one.

## Support Dashboard Overview
The support dashboard gives you a quick overview of all your tickets.

### Statistics
At the top, four stat cards summarize your ticket activity:

| Card | What It Shows |
|------|---------------|
| **Total Tickets** | The total number of tickets you've ever created |
| **Open Tickets** | Tickets that are currently active and awaiting a response |
| **Awaiting Your Reply** | Tickets where staff has replied and you need to respond |
| **Resolved Tickets** | Tickets that have been closed |

### Filtering and Search
Below the stats, you'll find filter buttons to narrow down your ticket list:

| Filter | Shows |
|--------|-------|
| **Active** | All non-closed tickets |
| **All** | Every ticket, including closed ones |
| **Awaiting You** | Tickets where staff is waiting on your reply |
| **In Progress** | Tickets staff are actively working on |
| **Closed** | Resolved or closed tickets |

There's also a **search box** to quickly find a ticket by subject or content.

### Ticket List
Each ticket in the list is displayed as a card showing:
- **Subject** -- the title of your ticket
- **Category** -- the type of issue (with an icon)
- **Status badge** -- color-coded current status
- **Last updated** -- when the ticket was last active
- **Server name** -- if linked to a specific server
- **Reply count** -- how many messages are in the thread
- **Staff avatars** -- which support members are involved

## Ticket Statuses

| Status | Color | Meaning |
|--------|-------|---------|
| **Open** | Green | Newly created or you've replied -- waiting for staff to respond |
| **Answered** | Orange | Staff has replied -- they're waiting for your response |
| **In Progress** | Blue | Staff is actively working on your issue |
| **Closed** | Gray | The ticket has been resolved or closed |

{: .info}
> When a ticket shows **Answered**, it means the ball is in your court. Check it and reply so staff can continue helping you.

## Creating a Ticket
Creating a ticket is a guided 3-step process.

### Step 1: Choose a Category
Select the category that best matches your issue:

| Category | Use For |
|----------|---------|
| **Technical Support** | Server issues, errors, crashes |
| **Billing** | Payment questions, invoice issues, subscription management |
| **Account Issues** | Email changes, account settings, account-related questions |
| **Feature Request** | Suggest new features or improvements |
| **Report Abuse** | Report rule violations, abuse, or inappropriate behavior |
| **Other** | Anything that doesn't fit the categories above |

### Step 2: Fill in the Details

**Priority** -- choose how urgent your issue is:

| Priority | When to Use |
|----------|-------------|
| **Low** | General questions, non-urgent requests |
| **Medium** | Standard issues that need attention (default) |
| **High** | Issues significantly affecting your service |
| **Urgent** | Critical problems like server outages |

{: .warning}
> **Urgent** priority immediately pings support staff for a fast response. It should only be used for genuinely critical situations -- server outages, security breaches, or infrastructure failures. Misusing urgent priority may result in warnings or restrictions.

**Related Server** -- optionally select the server this issue is about. This helps staff quickly identify your setup.

**Subject** -- give your ticket a clear, specific title (up to 100 characters).

**Description** -- explain your issue in detail (up to 2,000 characters). Markdown formatting is supported, so you can use **bold**, *italic*, `code blocks`, and lists to organize your message.

{: .info}
> As you type your subject and description, the system may suggest relevant Knowledge Base articles. Check them out -- your answer might already be documented!

### Step 3: Review and Submit
A summary of everything you entered is shown. Double-check the details, then click **"Submit Ticket"**{: .green } to create your ticket.

## Viewing and Replying to a Ticket
Click on any ticket from the dashboard to open it. The ticket view has two main sections.

### Ticket Details (Left Panel)
The sidebar shows all metadata about the ticket:
- **Status** -- current ticket status
- **Category** -- the issue type
- **Priority** -- urgency level
- **Created** -- when the ticket was opened
- **Last Updated** -- when the most recent activity happened
- **Related Servers** -- linked servers (if any)
- **Participants** -- who has access to this ticket

### Message Thread (Main Panel)
The main area shows the full conversation in chronological order. Each message displays the sender's name, role, avatar, and timestamp.

### Replying
At the bottom of the message thread, you'll find the reply composer:
1. Type your message in the text box (up to 5,000 characters).
2. Use the **Markdown toolbar** to format your text (bold, italic, code, lists, etc.).
3. Click the **attachment button** to upload files if needed.
4. Use **@mentions** to tag other participants (type `@` followed by a name).
5. Click **"Send"**{: .green } to post your reply.

{: .info}
> When you reply to a ticket that has the **Answered** status, it automatically changes back to **Open** so staff knows you've responded.

## Ticket Features

### File Attachments
You can attach files to any message in the ticket. Click the attachment button in the reply composer to upload files. Attached files appear in the message and can be downloaded by anyone with access to the ticket.

### @Mentions
Type `@` in the reply composer to see a list of mentionable users. Selecting a user sends them a notification so they're aware of your message.

### Message Reactions
You can react to any message with emoji reactions. Click the reaction button on a message to add your reaction. This is a quick way to acknowledge a response without writing a full reply.

### Edit and Delete Messages
Made a mistake? You can edit or delete your own messages:
- **Edit** -- click the edit option on your message, make changes, and save.
- **Delete** -- click the delete option to remove your message from the thread.

## Managing Your Ticket
You have several options for managing your tickets after creation.

### Changing Ticket Details
- **Rename** -- click on the ticket subject to edit it.
- **Change Category** -- update the category if your issue type changes.
- **Change Priority** -- adjust the priority level up or down.

### Adding Participants
You can share your ticket with other users by adding them as participants. Each participant can be given specific permissions:

| Permission | What It Allows |
|------------|----------------|
| **Read** | View the ticket and its messages |
| **Write** | View and reply to the ticket |
| **Manage** | View, reply, and change ticket settings (category, priority, close) |

To add a participant, open the ticket and use the participants section in the left panel.

### Closing and Reopening
When your issue is resolved, you can close the ticket by clicking the **"Close Ticket"**{: .red } button. If the issue comes back or you need further help, you can reopen a closed ticket at any time.

### Rating Staff
After a staff member has helped you, you can rate their support. The rating covers four areas:
- **Helpfulness** -- how well they addressed your issue
- **Professionalism** -- their communication and conduct
- **Knowledge** -- their technical expertise
- **Speed** -- how quickly they responded

Your feedback helps us improve the quality of support.

## Tips for Faster Support
- **Choose the right category** -- this routes your ticket to the right team member.
- **Be specific in your subject** -- "Server crashes when loading world" is better than "Help".
- **Include details in your description** -- what happened, when it started, what you've already tried.
- **Link your server** -- if the issue is server-related, select it when creating the ticket so staff can look into it immediately.
- **Attach screenshots or logs** -- a screenshot of an error message or a log file can save several back-and-forth messages.
- **Check KB suggestions** -- the system may suggest articles that solve your problem instantly.
- **Reply promptly** -- when a ticket shows **Answered**, staff is waiting on you. The sooner you reply, the sooner they can continue.
