## Introduction
If your account has been suspended, it means our systems detected activity that violates the User Agreement. This article explains why suspensions happen, what it means for your account and servers, and how to avoid it.

## Why Accounts Get Suspended
Account suspensions are issued for violations of our terms of service. The most common reasons include:

| Violation | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **AFK farming or idle activity** | Keeping servers running with no real activity to exploit free resources |
| **Fake player activity or bot usage** | Using bots or fake players to inflate player counts or bypass inactivity checks |
| **System abuse or exploitation** | Exploiting system resources, overloading nodes, or abusing platform features |
| **Violating the User Agreement or AUP** | Any other breach of the [User Agreement](https://falixnodes.net/user-agreement) or [Acceptable Use Policy](https://falixnodes.net/acceptable-use-policy) |

## What Happens When You're Suspended
Once your account is suspended:

- **Your account is locked** -- you cannot use any part of the platform. Every time you log in, you'll be redirected to a suspension page.
- **All servers are immediately suspended** -- every server on your account is shut down. You cannot start, access, or manage them.

## Can I Appeal?
No. Account suspensions are final and cannot be reversed. There is no appeal process.

## How to Avoid Suspension
- **Don't use bots or fake players** -- any artificial inflation of player counts will be detected.
- **Don't AFK farm** -- keeping servers running idle to exploit free resources is not allowed.
- **Don't exploit system resources** -- cryptocurrency mining and overloading nodes are strictly prohibited.
- **Follow the rules** -- read and follow the [User Agreement](https://falixnodes.net/user-agreement) and [Acceptable Use Policy](https://falixnodes.net/acceptable-use-policy).
