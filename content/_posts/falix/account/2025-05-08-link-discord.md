Linking your Discord account to your Falix account makes it easier for our support team to quickly identify and assist with your server issues. It also acts as a secure backup login method in case you lose access to your primary login option.

### Linking your account

1. Log in to the [Dashboard](https://client.falixnodes.net/).

2. In the navigation menu, open the "Account" category and navigate to [settings](https://client.falixnodes.net/profile/settings).

3. Under the "Discord" category, click the "Link Discord" button.

> If you already have another discord account linked, unlink it first by clicking "unlink discord".

4. Make sure the correct discord account is selected or log in to your account.

5. Scroll down and press "authorize".

6. Complete any additional verification if necessary.
