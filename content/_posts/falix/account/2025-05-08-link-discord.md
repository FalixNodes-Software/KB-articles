Linking your Discord account to your Falix account makes it easier for our support team to quickly identify and assist with your server issues. It also acts as a secure backup login method in case you lose access to your primary sign-in option.

### Linking your account

1. Log in to the [Dashboard](https://client.falixnodes.net/).

2. In the navigation menu, open the "Account" category and navigate to [settings](https://client.falixnodes.net/profile/settings).

3. Under the "discord" category, click the "link discord" button.

> If you already have another discord account linked then unlink that first by pressing "unlink discord"

4. Make sure that the right discord account is selected or log in into your account.

5. Scroll down and press "authorize".

6. Complete any extra verification if needed.
