            <p>
              You must use our services in compliance with our
              <a href="https://falixnodes.net/acceptable-use-policy">Acceptable Use Policy</a>.
              Any breach of the AUP may result in immediate suspension or
              termination of your account.
            </p>
            <p>
              Free services may be restricted or limited in certain geographic regions.
            </p>

            <h2 class="mt-4">7. Cancellation, Refunds, and Inactivity</h2>
            <p>
              You may cancel our services or delete your account at any time.
              <strong>For recurring services, payment processing begins 3 days before
              the due date to ensure uninterrupted service. To cancel and avoid charges
              for the next billing period, you must submit a cancellation request at
              least 4 days before the invoice due date.</strong> By subscribing to
              recurring services, you explicitly consent to this early payment processing.
              Cancellation requests submitted after payment processing has begun cannot
              result in a refund for that billing period.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Cancellation Options:</strong> When cancelling, you may choose between:
              (a) Immediate cancellation - service access ends immediately with no refund
              for remaining days in the current billing period; or
              (b) End-of-billing-period cancellation - service continues until the end of
              the current paid period, then terminates automatically without renewal.
              Services are provided on a prepaid basis and no pro-rata refunds are given
              for partial use of a billing period regardless of which option you choose.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Account Deletion:</strong> When you request account deletion, your
              account will be scheduled for deletion 14 days after the request is submitted.
              During this 14-day period, you may revoke your deletion request by logging
              in to your account. After the 14-day period expires, your data will be handled
              in accordance with our <a href="https://falixnodes.net/privacy-notice">Privacy Notice</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Upon cancellation or deletion, we will remove your data in
              accordance with our
              <a href="https://falixnodes.net/privacy-notice">Privacy Notice</a>,
              unless we are required or permitted by law to retain certain records.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you delete your account or servers, all associated data will be
              permanently removed, and no recovery will be possible.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Refunds:</strong> We offer a 14-day refund period for qualifying purchases, in
              compliance with EU consumer protection regulations, unless
              you have explicitly waived this right. Refund requests for recurring payments are not possible.
              You may not initiate chargebacks through payment gateways without
              contacting us first. Unauthorized chargebacks may lead to immediate
              account termination and an additional fee of 20 EUR.
              Refund requests must be submitted through our
              <a href="https://client.falixnodes.net/support/">support panel</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Inactivity:</strong> We reserve the right to remove free servers or services if your
              account remains inactive for a period of more than 30 days. The data will be
              deleted and cannot be restored.
            </p>

            <h2 class="mt-4">8. Support</h2>
            <p>
              Official support is provided solely through our
              <a href="https://client.falixnodes.net/support/">ticket system</a>.
              We make no guarantee of instant responses, but we will endeavor
              to address inquiries in a timely manner.
            </p>
            <p>
              Support or advice from users who are not part of our official

              representation by Falix.
            </p>

            <h2 class="mt-4">9. Service Levels and Performance</h2>
            <p>
              By using our services, you agree to our
              <a href="https://falixnodes.net/service-level-agreement">
                Service Level Agreement (SLA)
              </a>. We will make reasonable efforts to minimize downtime
              and schedule maintenance in a manner that reduces impact
              on your usage.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Unmetered Services:</strong> If your plan is described as "unmetered" or "unmeasured,"
              you may utilize the specified resources without a fixed usage cap.
              However, we reserve the right to impose software or hardware
              limitations if your usage significantly exceeds normal operational
              conditions (e.g., excessive large file storage, abuse).
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Performance Guarantees:</strong> Certain paid plans include coverage such as dedicated CPU power,
              dedicated RAM, or performance boosts. A violation of these
              coverage guarantees occurs if the host machine remains at or
              above 90% usage of the relevant resource for a sustained period
              (e.g., 10 minutes), affecting your service performance.
              If we fail to meet these guarantees, you may request a full refund
              for the relevant billing period of the affected service.
            </p>

            <h2 class="mt-4">10. Beta Services</h2>
            <p>
              From time to time, Falix may invite you to use or test certain pre-release or
              "<em>beta</em>" features, services, or functionalities. Such Beta Services are
              provided on an "as-is" basis, may contain bugs or errors, and may be substantially
              modified or discontinued at any time. Your use of any Beta Services is at your own risk,
              and Falix disclaims all warranties related thereto.
            </p>

              and transmit your User Content solely for the purpose of operating, developing, and
              improving our Services. This license terminates when you delete your User Content or
              your account, unless your User Content has been shared with others who have not deleted it.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Copyright Infringement:</strong> If you believe that any content available through our Services infringes your

            </p>

            <h2 class="mt-4">12. Indemnification</h2>
            <p>
              To the extent allowed by applicable law, you agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless
              Falix, its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, and licensors from any
              claims, damages, losses, liabilities, judgments, costs, or expenses (including reasonable
              attorneys' fees) arising out of or related to:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Your use of the Services or any User Content you submit;</li>
              <li>Your violation of this Agreement or any applicable law;</li>
              <li>Your infringement or violation of any third-party right, including intellectual

            </ul>

            <h2 class="mt-4">13. Disclaimer, Limitation of Liability, and Force Majeure</h2>
            <p>
              Our services are provided on an "as-is" and "as-available" basis without any express or implied
              warranties, including without limitation any warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular
              purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, Falix disclaims all liability for any indirect,
              incidental, consequential, special, or punitive damages arising from or in connection with the use or
              inability to use our services—even if Falix has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or liabilities. In such instances, our
              liability shall be limited to the maximum extent permitted by local law. Nothing in this limitation
              affects your statutory rights as an EU consumer which cannot be waived by contract.
            </p>
            <p>
              Falix is not liable for any failure to perform under this Agreement if such failure
              results from any cause beyond Falix's reasonable control, including but not limited
              to acts of God, war, terrorism, riots, embargoes, acts of civil or military authorities,
              fire, floods, accidents, network infrastructure failures, strikes, or shortages of
              transportation, facilities, fuel, energy, labor, or materials.
            </p>

            <h2 class="mt-4">14. Governing Law, Severability, and Language</h2>
            <p>
              This Agreement is governed by the laws of Latvia and applicable
              EU regulations. If you are a consumer in the EU, you retain any
              mandatory rights granted by your local consumer protection laws.
              Nothing in this Agreement limits your ability to pursue claims
              in your local courts or via alternative dispute resolution.
            </p>
            <p>
              If any provision of this Agreement is found to be invalid or
              unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining
              provisions shall remain in full force and effect. An invalid
              provision will be replaced by a valid one that closely reflects
              the original intent and economic effect.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between the English version of this
              Agreement and any translation, the English version shall take precedence.
              However, nothing in this section shall affect your mandatory rights under EU law
              to receive consumer-related information in your local language.
            </p>

            <h2 class="mt-4">15. Entire Agreement and Contact</h2>
