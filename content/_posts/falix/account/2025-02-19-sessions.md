## Introduction
The sessions page shows you every device currently logged into your account. You can review session details and terminate sessions you don't recognize.

## Viewing Active Sessions

1. Navigate to [Sessions](https://client.falixnodes.net/profile/sessions).
2. Each session card shows:

| Detail | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Device type | Desktop, Mobile, Tablet, or Bot |
| Platform | Operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android) |
| Browser | Browser name and version |
| IP address | The IP the session is connected from |
| Location | Country with flag |
| Last activity | How long ago the session was last used |
| Login time | When the session started |
| Pages visited | Number of pages opened in the session |

Your current session is marked with a green **This device** badge.

## Terminating Sessions

{% tabs sessions %}

{% tab sessions Single Session %}

To sign out of a specific device:
1. Find the session you want to end.
2. Click the **Terminate** button on that session card.
3. The session will be ended immediately.

{: .info}
> You cannot terminate your current session from this page. To sign out of your current device, use the logout button in the navigation menu.

{% endtab %}

{% tab sessions All Sessions %}

To sign out of all other devices at once:
1. Click the **Sign out everywhere** button.
2. All sessions except your current one will be terminated.

This is useful if you suspect unauthorized access to your account.

{% endtab %}

{% endtabs %}

## Session History

Below the active sessions, you'll find a history table showing recent sessions including:
- Device and browser used
- Location
- Login time and duration
- Whether the session is still active or has ended

{: .warning}
> If you see sessions from locations or devices you don't recognize, terminate them immediately and change your password. Consider enabling [2FA](falix/account/general/add-2fa) for extra security.
