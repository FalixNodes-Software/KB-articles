## Refund Policy

We offer a **14-day money-back guarantee** on your first purchase. If you're not satisfied with our service, you can request a full refund within 14 days of your first payment.

### Key Points

- The 14-day window starts from the date of your **first payment**
- Refunds are only available for your **first purchase** - subsequent payments are not eligible
- Refunds are processed to your **original payment method** and may take 3-10 business days to appear
- Upon refund, **all premium servers are immediately cancelled** and all data is **permanently deleted**
- Refunds are **not available after 14 days** from your first payment - no exceptions
- Partial refunds are not available through the self-service process

{: .warning}
> Billing cycle cancellations are **not** refunds. When you cancel a server through the billing dashboard, your server remains active until the end of the billing period and you receive prorated credit — no money is returned to your payment method.

## Before Requesting a Refund

Before you request a refund, consider whether one of these alternatives might solve your issue:

### Want different resources?
You can upgrade or downgrade your server's RAM and CPU at any time from the [Server Settings](https://client.falixnodes.net/server/settings). Prorated credits are applied automatically - no refund needed.

### Want a different server or location?
You can delete your current server and create a new one with a different location. You'll receive prorated credit for the remaining time on your cancelled server.

### Finding it too expensive?
You can reduce your server resources or switch to a longer billing cycle (quarterly, 6-month, or annual) for up to 20% off.

### Server not working properly?
Our support team can help resolve most server issues quickly. [Contact Support](https://client.falixnodes.net/support/) before requesting a refund.

## How To Request a Refund

1. Log in to the [Dashboard](https://client.falixnodes.net/).
2. Navigate to [Billing](https://client.falixnodes.net/billing).
3. Scroll down to the **Invoices** section and click **View** on your first invoice.
4. On the invoice page, click the **Request Refund** button in the bottom-right corner.
5. Select the reason for your refund. We'll suggest alternatives that might help — review them before proceeding.
6. If you still want a refund, click **I still want a refund**.
7. Review the confirmation screen carefully — this action **cannot be undone**.
8. Click **Yes, Refund** to confirm.

## What Happens After a Refund

Once your refund is processed:

- All premium servers on your account are **immediately cancelled**
- All server data is **permanently deleted** and cannot be recovered
- Your subscription is cancelled
- The refund amount is returned to your original payment method within **3-10 business days**
- Your account reverts to the free plan

{: .warning}
> Server data cannot be recovered after a refund. Make sure to back up any important files before requesting a refund.

## Troubleshooting

- **"Request Refund" button not visible**: The button only appears on your first invoice and only within 14 days of your first payment. If the 14-day window has passed, you are no longer eligible.
- **Refund not appearing**: Refunds can take 3-10 business days to appear on your statement depending on your payment provider.
