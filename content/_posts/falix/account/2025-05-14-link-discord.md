Linking your Discord account to your Falix account makes it easier for you to log in to your account, and also allows our support team to quickly identify and assist you.

### Linking your account

1. Log in to the [Dashboard](https://client.falixnodes.net/).

2. Navigate to your [Profile Settings](https://client.falixnodes.net/profile/settings).

3. Under the "Discord" section, click the "Link Discord" button.

    > If you already have another Discord account linked, click "Unlink Discord" first to remove it.

4. If not already logged in, log in to the Discord account you want to link.

5. Scroll down and press "Authorize" to grant the necessary permissions.

6. If prompted, complete any additional verification steps.
