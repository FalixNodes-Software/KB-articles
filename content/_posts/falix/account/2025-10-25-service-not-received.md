## Introduction
If you've purchased a service but haven't received it in your dashboard, don't worry. This guide will help you troubleshoot the most common reasons why your service might not be showing up.

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Mismatch Between Billing and Dashboard Accounts
The most common reason for not receiving your service is logging into a different account than the one used for billing.

**Solution:**
1. Check the email address you used when making the payment.
2. Make sure you're logged into the [Falix Client Area](https://client.falixnodes.net/) with the same email address.
3. If you have multiple accounts, try logging out and logging in with the correct account.
4. Check your email for the order confirmation to verify which account the service was assigned to.

### Payment Not Processed
Sometimes payments may not complete successfully, even if you've gone through the checkout process.

**Solution:**
1. Check your email for a payment confirmation.
2. Log in to the [Falix Billing Area](https://billing.falixnodes.net/) and navigate to **Billing** > **Invoices**.
3. Look for your recent invoice and check its status:
   - **Paid**: Your payment was processed successfully
   - **Unpaid**: Your payment was not completed
4. If the invoice shows as unpaid, you can click on it and complete the payment.
5. Check with your bank or payment provider to ensure the transaction wasn't declined.

### Service Pending Activation
In some cases, your service may require a few minutes to be activated after payment.

**Solution:**
1. Wait 5-10 minutes after payment confirmation.
2. Refresh your dashboard or log out and log back in.
3. Check the **Services** page in the client area.

### Wrong Server Location or Resources
If you received your service but it's not configured as expected, you may need to adjust the settings.

**Solution:**
1. Log in to the [Falix Client Area](https://client.falixnodes.net/).
2. Navigate to your service.
3. To change resources:
   - Go to the [Server Settings](https://client.falixnodes.net/server/settings)
   - Look for resource allocation settings
   - Adjust CPU, RAM, or storage as needed
4. To transfer your server to a new location:
   - Navigate to your [Server Console](https://falixnodes.net/server/console.php)
   - On the right side of the console, locate the card showing your current server location
   - Click on the server location card
   - Select your preferred location and confirm the transfer
