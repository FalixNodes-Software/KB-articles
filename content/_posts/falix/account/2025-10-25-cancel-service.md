## Introduction
If you need to cancel your Falix service, you can do so by submitting a cancellation request through our billing system. This guide will walk you through the process of requesting a service cancellation.

## Before You Cancel
Before proceeding with the cancellation, please note:
- Cancellation requests are processed instantly
- Make sure to backup any important data before cancelling
- Once cancelled, your data may not be recoverable

{: .warning}
> To avoid being charged for the next billing cycle, submit your cancellation request at least 4 days before your renewal date.

## Steps to Cancel Your Service
1. Log in to the [Falix Billing Area](https://billing.falixnodes.net/).
2. Navigate to **Services** in the top menu.
3. Click on the service you want to cancel.
4. In the left sidebar, click the **Request Cancellation** button.
5. Select your cancellation type:
   - **Immediate**: Cancels the service immediately (you will lose access to remaining paid time and no refund will be issued)
   - **End of Billing Period**: Keeps your service active until your current billing period ends (recommended)
6. Select a reason for cancellation from the dropdown menu. This helps us improve our services.
7. (Optional) Provide additional feedback in the text box to let us know more about your experience.
8. Click **Request Cancellation** to submit your request.

## After Submitting
Once you've submitted your cancellation request:
- Your cancellation will be processed instantly
- You will receive a confirmation email
- If you selected **Immediate**, your service will be terminated right away
- If you selected **End of Billing Period**, your service will remain active until the current billing cycle ends

{: .warning}
> Make sure to download any important files or configurations before your service is cancelled. Once a service is cancelled, we cannot guarantee data recovery.
