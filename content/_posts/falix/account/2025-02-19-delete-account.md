## Introduction
You can delete your Falix account at any time from your profile settings. Account deletion is permanent, but there is a **14-day cooldown period** during which you can cancel the request by simply logging back in.

## Before You Delete

{: .warning}
> Account deletion is **permanent and irreversible**. Once the 14-day cooldown expires, all your data will be permanently deleted and cannot be recovered.

The following data will be permanently deleted:
- Your user account
- All servers and their files
- All databases associated with your servers
- All backups associated with your servers

{: .info}
> If you have an active billing subscription, make sure to cancel it before deleting your account to avoid any further charges.

## How to Delete Your Account

1. Log in to the [Falix Client Area](https://client.falixnodes.net/).
2. Navigate to **Profile** -> [Settings](https://client.falixnodes.net/profile/settings).
3. Scroll to the bottom and click the **Delete Account** button.
4. A confirmation modal will appear. Read the warnings carefully.
5. Type **YES** (case-sensitive) in the confirmation field.
6. If you have two-factor authentication enabled, enter your 6-digit 2FA code.
7. Click **Confirm Deletion**.

You will be logged out immediately after submitting the request.

## The 14-Day Cooldown

After submitting a deletion request, your account enters a **14-day cooldown period**:

| Day | Status |
|-----|--------|
| Day 0 | Deletion requested, account marked as pending |
| Days 1–13 | Cooldown period — you can cancel by logging in |
| Day 14+ | Account and all data permanently deleted |

### Cancel Your Deletion Request
Changed your mind? Simply **log in** to your account during the 14-day cooldown. Your deletion request will be automatically cancelled and your account will be restored to normal.

{: .info}
> You can submit a new deletion request at any time after cancelling a previous one.

## After Deletion
Once the 14-day cooldown expires and your account is deleted:
- You will no longer be able to log in
- All servers are removed and their files are permanently deleted
- Your account cannot be recovered — you would need to create a new one

{: .info}
> Certain data may be retained after your account is deleted. Billing records, invoices, and transaction history are kept as required by law for tax and accounting purposes. Security logs may also be retained for fraud prevention and abuse protection.
