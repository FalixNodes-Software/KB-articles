## Introduction

Mods are one of the best reasons to run your own Minecraft server. They let you completely transform the game -- add entirely new dimensions, build complex tech and automation systems, explore magic and spellcasting, introduce new creatures, or even just squeeze better performance out of your server with optimization mods. If vanilla Minecraft ever starts to feel limited, mods are how you break past those limits.

The **Mods** page on Falix makes this easy. You can browse, search, and install mods directly from Modrinth and CurseForge without ever leaving the dashboard. Results from both platforms are combined and automatically deduplicated, so you get a single clean list to work with.

### A Quick Word About Mod Loaders

Before you start installing mods, it helps to understand mod loaders. A mod loader is the software that actually makes mods work on your server. Your server needs to be running a mod loader, and every mod you install needs to match that loader. Here is a quick breakdown:

- **Forge** -- The long-standing standard. Forge has the largest mod library and has been around for years. If you are looking for big, well-known modpacks or older mods, Forge is usually the way to go.
- **Fabric** -- A lightweight, modern alternative. Fabric is known for fast updates to new Minecraft versions and excellent performance mods (like Sodium and Lithium). Great if you want a lean setup or play on the latest version.
- **NeoForge** -- A community fork of Forge that started with Minecraft 1.20.2. It aims to modernize the Forge ecosystem while maintaining broad mod compatibility. If you are starting a new Forge-style server on a recent Minecraft version, NeoForge is worth considering.
- **Quilt** -- A fork of Fabric focused on community governance and inclusivity. It is compatible with most Fabric mods and adds some of its own features on top.

{: .warning}
> Make sure your mods are compatible with both your mod loader and your Minecraft version. A Forge mod will not work on a Fabric server, and a mod built for 1.20.1 might not load on 1.21. Always double-check before installing.

## Browsing Mods

### Search

Type a mod name into the search bar and results will appear from both Modrinth and CurseForge at the same time. Duplicate entries are automatically merged using slug matching, so you will not see the same mod listed twice. When you search, results are automatically sorted by relevance. When browsing without a search term, results are sorted by downloads by default. You can change the sort order anytime using the filters.

### Advanced Filters

Click the filter button to expand the advanced filters panel. These let you narrow down results so you can find exactly what you are looking for:

{% tabs filters %}

{% tab filters Sort & Categories %}

- **Sort By** -- Choose between Relevance, Downloads (default), Follows, Newest, or Recently Updated.
- **Categories** -- Filter by what the mod does: Adventure, Decoration, Technology, Magic, Utility, World Generation, Optimization, Library, or Any.

{% endtab %}

{% tab filters Loader & Version %}

| Filter | Options |
|--------|---------|
| **Mod Loaders** | Any, Forge, Fabric, NeoForge, Quilt |
| **Game Version** | Dropdown populated with available Minecraft versions |

{% endtab %}

{% tab filters Environment & Flags %}

| Filter | Options |
|--------|---------|
| **Environment** | Any, Server-side, Client-side, Both |
| **Featured Only** | Toggle to show only featured mods |
| **Open Source Only** | Toggle to show only open-source mods |

{% endtab %}

{% endtabs %}

Click **Reset Filters** to restore everything to defaults.

{: .info}
> Server-side mods run entirely on the server and do not require players to install anything on their end. If you want a hassle-free experience for your players, look for mods tagged as server-side.

### View Modes

You can toggle between two layouts:

- **Card View** -- A 3-column grid that shows mod icons, descriptions, and stats at a glance. This is the default.
- **List View** -- Compact rows that let you scan through more mods quickly.

Your preference is saved across sessions, so you only need to set it once.

### Pagination

Results are displayed 9 mods per page. Use the navigation buttons at the top or bottom of the page to move between pages -- you can go to the first page, step forward or backward, or jump to a specific page number.

## Mod Cards

Every mod in the results shows you the key information at a glance:

- **Icon** -- The mod's logo (or a placeholder if one is not set)
- **Name and Author** -- Who made it and what it is called
- **Category** -- The mod's primary category (Technology, Magic, Optimization, etc.)
- **Description** -- A short summary of what the mod does
- **Downloads and Follows** -- How popular it is
- **Last Updated** -- When the mod was last updated, shown as relative time (e.g. "3 days ago")
- **Source Badge** -- Shows whether the listing comes from Modrinth or CurseForge

## Mod Details

Click on any mod to open a detail modal where you can learn more and install it. The modal has three tabs:

### Overview

The overview gives you the full picture: a complete description (rendered from Markdown), download and follower statistics, and metadata including supported categories, mod loaders, platforms, environment (client/server/both), compatible game versions, and the license. You will also find external links here -- things like the mod's GitHub repository, wiki, Discord server, issue tracker, and donation page when available.

There is an **Install** button that takes you straight to the Versions tab so you can pick a specific version to install.

### Gallery

If the mod author has uploaded screenshots or images, they will appear here. Click any image to view it fullscreen.

### Versions

This is where you pick which version of the mod to install. Versions are listed in a paginated table (20 per page) and you can filter them down:

{% tabs versions %}

{% tab versions Filters %}

| Filter | Options |
|--------|---------|
| **Platform/Loader** | Forge, Fabric, NeoForge, Quilt |
| **Game Version** | Filter to a specific Minecraft version |
| **Version Type** | Release, Beta, Alpha |

{% endtab %}

{% tab versions Version Info %}

Each version entry shows:

- **Version name** and release date
- **Compatible game versions** and supported loaders
- **Download count**
- An **Install** button
- A badge on the latest version so you can spot it quickly

{% endtab %}

{% endtabs %}

## Installing Mods

Once you have found the version you want, click the **Install** button. The mod file is downloaded directly to your server's `/mods` directory -- the primary file is selected automatically, so you do not need to worry about picking the right download.

A notification will confirm when the installation is complete.

{: .info}
> After installing mods, you will need to restart your server for them to take effect. Head to the console page and restart when you are ready.

## Free Plan Restrictions

Some resource-intensive mods are not available on free plan servers to keep things running smoothly for everyone. These include:

- **World pre-generation mods** -- Chunky, ChunkMaster, and similar tools
- **Dynamic map mods** -- Dynmap, BlueMap, SquareMap, JourneyMap, Xaero's Map

{: .info}
> Premium users have no mod restrictions. If you need any of these mods, upgrading your plan will unlock them.

{: .info}
> To see which mods are currently installed on your server, check the [My Addons](/falix/dashboard/content/my-addons) page. It shows all your installed plugins, mods, and data packs in one place, with update checking and version tracking powered by Modrinth.

## Partial Results Warning

Falix pulls mod data from both Modrinth and CurseForge simultaneously. If one of those sources fails to respond, a warning banner will appear at the top of the page letting you know that some results may be missing. Badges next to the warning will indicate which source had the issue. You can still browse and install from the source that is working -- just be aware that the full catalog might not be showing.
