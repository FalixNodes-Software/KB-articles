## What Is SFTP?

SFTP, or **S**ecure **F**ile **T**ransfer **P**rotocol, ensures secure file access, transfer, and management over an encrypted data stream. Meaning you are able to manage files remotely through an external SFTP client without having to access the [Dashboard](https://client.falixnodes.net/).

> Although, depending on your SFTP client, you may have access to features such as sorting, filtering, file synchronization, and properties, it is still recommended to stick to the Dashboard as it contains a recycle bin and is much faster than SFTP.

## Choosing a SFTP Client:

| SFTP client                                                                            | Supported platforms       |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| [Filezilla](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?type=client)                    | Windows, MacOS, and Linux |
| [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/download/)                                            | Windows and MacOS         |
| [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/download.php)                                          | Windows                   |
| [AndFTP](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=lysesoft.andftp&hl=en_US&gl=US) | Android                   |
| [FTPManager](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ftpmanager-ftp-sftp-client/id525959186)     | IOS                       |

## Establishing a SFTP Connection to Your Server:

### Finding Your SFTP Credentials:

1. Log in to the [Dashboard](https://client.falixnodes.net/).

2. Scroll down and locate your server, then click on "Play".

3. You will be redirected to your server's [Console page](https://client.falixnodes.net/server/console). In the top navigation bar, hover over "Advanced", then navigate to [FTP Access](https://client.falixnodes.net/server/sftp).

4. Under "SFTP Details", take a note of your SFTP details.

{: .warning}

> Do **NOT** share your SFTP credentials with anyone unless you absolutely trust them. These credentials will allow **anyone** to access and delete your files.

> If you wish to reset your SFTP password, you may do so by clicking on "Change Password" under "Danger Zone" in the [Settings page](https://client.falixnodes.net/profile/settings).

### Connecting With Your SFTP Client:

1. Launch your SFTP client.

2. Follow the table below and input your credentials in the appropriate fields:

| SFTP details | Description                                                                                               |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Protocol     | Make sure it is **always** set to `SFTP`.                                                                 |
| Host-name    | The string of characters between `sftp://` and the colon (`:`). It should resemble `xxx.falixserver.net`. |
| Port         | The string of numbers after the colon (`:`).                                                              |
| User-name    | Your SFTP user.                                                                                           |
| Password:    | Your SFTP password.                                                                                       |

> An alternate but easier option would be to click on "Launch SFTP" in the dashboard and inputting your SFTP password, however this only works on some devices.
