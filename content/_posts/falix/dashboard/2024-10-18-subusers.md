## What Are Sub-Users?

Running a server is a lot more fun when you don't have to do everything yourself. Maybe you want your friend to help install plugins, or you need a trusted admin to keep things running while you're away. That's exactly what sub-users are for.

Sub-users let you share access to your server with other people while keeping your account safe and secure. You stay in full control by choosing exactly which permissions each person gets, so nobody can do more than you want them to.

{: .info}
> If you just want to let other people start your server, without giving them server access, we recommend referring to the [External Start Guide](/falix/dashboard/automation/external-start).

## Role Presets

When adding a sub-user, you can choose a role preset to quickly assign a pre-configured set of permissions. This saves time when you don't need a fully custom setup.

| Role | What It's For |
| ---- | ------------- |
| Admin | Full access to everything on the server. Best for trusted co-owners. |
| Moderator | Can manage the server, files, and view most settings, but can't manage sub-users or delete things. |
| Support | Read-only access to most areas, plus the ability to start and stop the server. Great for helpers who need to monitor things without making changes. |
| Custom | Pick and choose exactly which permissions you want. Start from scratch and build your own. |

After selecting a role, you can always fine-tune individual permissions before saving.

## Permission List

When you add a sub-user, you get to pick exactly what they can and can't do on your server. Permissions are organized into categories, and every permission is a separate checkbox, so you can mix and match to create the perfect level of access for each person.

A couple of tips before you dive in:
- **Start with minimal permissions and add more as needed.** It's always easier to grant extra access later than to deal with an accidental change.
- **Use the "Select All" option for trusted co-owners** who you want to have the same level of control as you.

Here's the full list of available permissions, grouped by category:

## Managing Sub-Users

To get to the sub-users page, here's what you need to do:

1. Log in to the [Dashboard](https://client.falixnodes.net/).

2. Choose a server within your server list.

3. Navigate to the [Subusers](https://client.falixnodes.net/server/subusers) page from your server's sidebar menu.

### Adding a Sub-User

1. On the [Users](https://client.falixnodes.net/server/subusers) page, click the "**Add User**{: .blue }" button.

2. In the field provided, enter the Falix email or username of the person you want to share access with.

3. Choose a role preset (Admin, Moderator, Support, or Custom) to quickly assign a starting set of permissions. If you pick Custom, the full permission list will expand so you can select individual permissions.

4. Fine-tune any specific permissions as needed. You can always come back and adjust these later.

5. Click "**Add User**{: .green }" at the bottom of the prompt to confirm and give them access to your server.

### Editing a Sub-User

1. On the [Users](https://client.falixnodes.net/server/subusers) page, click on the sub-user you want to edit.

2. The modal will open with their current permissions pre-selected. You can change their role preset or adjust individual permissions.

3. Click "**Update**{: .blue }" to save the changes.

{: .info}
> If you have two-factor authentication enabled, you'll need to verify your identity with a 2FA code before making changes to sub-users.

### Removing a Sub-User

1. On the [Users](https://client.falixnodes.net/server/subusers) page, click on the sub-user you want to remove.

2. Click "**Revoke**{: .red }" to remove them from the server. Their access will be taken away immediately.

## Premium Subuser Feature

If you're a premium user who has been added as a sub-user on someone else's free server, you can share your premium benefits with that server. This is called "marking" a server as premium.

When you mark a server as premium, the server gets access to premium features like Git integration and other perks, using your plan's resources. You can unmark the server at any time to reclaim your resources.

{: .info}
> Only premium users who are sub-users on a free server can use this feature. If the server owner already has a premium plan, the server already has premium benefits.
