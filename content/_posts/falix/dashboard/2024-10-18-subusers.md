## What Are Sub-Users?

Running a server is a lot more fun when you don't have to do everything yourself. Maybe you want your friend to help install plugins, or you need a trusted admin to keep things running while you're away. That's exactly what sub-users are for.

Sub-users let you share access to your server with other people while keeping your account safe and secure. You stay in full control by choosing exactly which permissions each person gets, so nobody can do more than you want them to.

> If you just want to let other people start your server, without giving them server access, we recommend referring to the [External Start Guide](https://kb.falixnodes.net/falix/dashboard/server/external-start).

## Permission List

When you add a sub-user, you get to pick exactly what they can and can't do on your server. Every permission is a separate checkbox, so you can mix and match to create the perfect level of access for each person.

A couple of tips before you dive in:
- **Start with minimal permissions and add more as needed.** It's always easier to grant extra access later than to deal with an accidental change.
- **The "Grant All Permissions" option is handy for trusted co-owners** who you want to have the same level of control as you.

Here's the full list of available permissions:

| Permission                            | What It Does                                                                                             |
