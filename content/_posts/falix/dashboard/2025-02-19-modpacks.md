## Introduction
Modpacks are curated collections of mods that have been bundled together and tested to work as a package. Instead of hunting down dozens of individual mods and troubleshooting compatibility issues yourself, a modpack gives you a ready-to-play experience right out of the box. Whether you want a tech-focused survival challenge, a magic-themed adventure, or a completely overhauled hardcore world, there is a modpack for it. Popular examples include All the Mods, RLCraft, and SkyFactory.

The Modpacks page on the Falix dashboard lets you browse, install, and update modpacks from multiple sources. When you install one, Falix automatically handles the mod loader, Java version, and startup settings for you -- no manual configuration needed.

> Installing a modpack reconfigures your entire server, replacing existing server files. Always create a backup before installing or updating a modpack so you can roll back if anything goes wrong.

## Browsing Modpacks

### Search

Type a modpack name into the search bar to start looking. By default, results are pulled from both Modrinth and CurseForge at the same time, with duplicates automatically removed so you see a clean list.

### Source Selection

Use the source selector to choose where you want to browse modpacks from:

- **Modrinth + CurseForge** -- Combines results from Modrinth and CurseForge into a single list with automatic deduplication. This is the default and usually the best starting point.
- **Technic** -- Browse modpacks hosted on the Technic Platform.
- **FTB** -- Browse Feed the Beast modpacks specifically.

### Advanced Filters

You can narrow down your search results with a couple of handy filters:

- **Sort By** -- Order results by Relevance, Downloads (the default), Follows, Newest, or Recently Updated.
- **Game Version** -- Filter results to only show modpacks that support a specific Minecraft version.

If your filters get too restrictive, just click **Reset Filters** to go back to the defaults.

### View Modes

You can toggle between **Card View** (a 3-column grid, which is the default) and **List View** (compact rows that show more results at once). Whichever you pick is saved across sessions, so you will not have to set it every time.

### Pagination

Results are displayed 9 modpacks per page. Use the first, previous, and next buttons to navigate, or jump directly to a specific page number.

## Installed Modpack Status

If you already have a modpack installed on your server, a status card appears at the top of the page. This gives you a quick summary of what is running: the modpack name, its icon, the installed version, when it was installed, and whether it is up to date.

The update status will show one of the following:

- **Up to date** -- You are running the latest version.
- **Update Available** -- A newer version exists, and the card will tell you which one.
- **Update check unavailable** -- The system could not check for updates (this happens with Technic and FTB modpacks).

Click the status card to jump into the modpack's full details page.

### Updating a Modpack

When an update is available for a Modrinth or CurseForge modpack, an **Update** button appears right on the status card. Clicking it opens a confirmation modal that shows your current version alongside the latest version so you can see exactly what is changing.

{: .warning}
> Updating a modpack will override existing server files. Create a backup before updating.

{: .info}
> Automatic update detection is only available for Modrinth and CurseForge modpacks. Technic and FTB modpacks do not support this feature, so you will need to check for updates manually on those platforms.

## Modpack Details

Click on any modpack card to open a detail modal with two tabs:

### Overview

This tab gives you the full picture: the modpack's description, author information, download and follower statistics, categories, and links to external pages. It is a great way to learn more about a modpack before committing to installing it.

### Versions

Here you will find a paginated list of every available version (20 per page). You can filter by game version, platform/loader, and version type (Release, Beta, or Alpha). Each entry shows the version name, release date, supported Minecraft versions, and an **Install** button.

## Installing a Modpack

{: .warning}
> Installing a modpack will override existing server files. Create a backup before installing.

Once you have found the modpack and version you want, click the **Install** button. Falix takes care of the rest automatically:

1. Detects the required mod loader (Forge, Fabric, NeoForge, or Quilt).
2. Determines the correct Minecraft version.
3. Selects the appropriate Java version.
4. Updates the server's egg, startup command, and Docker image.
5. Sets environment variables for the modpack.
6. Writes the EULA file.
7. Triggers a server reinstall.

Your server will enter an **Installing** state while this process runs. Once it finishes, just start your server as you normally would and you are good to go.

{: .info}
> If the modpack you installed does not seem to be working correctly, double-check that the Minecraft version and mod loader match what your client is using. Mismatches between the server and client are the most common cause of connection issues.

### Java Version Selection

The system automatically selects the correct Java version based on the Minecraft version the modpack targets. Here is the mapping it uses:

| Minecraft Version | Java Version |
|-------------------|-------------|
| 1.8--1.15 | Java 8 |
| 1.16--1.17 | Java 16 |
| 1.18--1.19 | Java 17 |
| 1.20+ | Java 21 |

You generally do not need to worry about this -- it is handled for you. But if you ever run into startup errors related to Java, this table is a handy reference to make sure things line up.
