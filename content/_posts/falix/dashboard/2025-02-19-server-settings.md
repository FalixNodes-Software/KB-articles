## Making Your Server Feel Like Yours
If you run more than one server, you've probably experienced the moment where you stare at your server list and think, "Wait, which one is which?" That's exactly what the **General** tab on your server's **Settings** page is for. It lets you give each server its own name, description, icon, and crash notification preference so you can tell them apart at a glance and stay on top of any issues.

Let's walk through each setting.

---

## Changing the Server Name
Your server name is the first thing you see in your server list, so picking a clear, recognizable name goes a long way — especially when you're managing several servers at once. Instead of leaving the default name, try something descriptive like "Survival SMP," "Creative Build," or "Modded 1.20" so you always know which server you're clicking into.

To change it:

1. Navigate to your server's **Settings** page.
2. On the **General** tab, click the **Server Name** card.
3. Type in your new name (up to 20 characters).
4. Click **Save**.

{: .info}
> Keep your name short and meaningful. You only have 20 characters to work with, so abbreviations like "SMP" or "Hub" can help you stay within the limit while still being descriptive.

---

## Changing the Description
The description appears underneath your server's name in your server list. Think of it as a quick note to yourself — it's a handy spot to jot down what the server is for, who plays on it, or what version it's running.

For example, you might write something like "Vanilla 1.21 for friends" or "Testing new modpack — do not delete." It's entirely for your own reference, so use it however it helps you.

To update it:

1. On the **General** tab, click the **Server Description** card.
2. Write your description (up to 255 characters).
3. Click **Save**.

## Changing the Server Icon
Icons give your servers a visual identity in your server list. When you're scrolling through multiple servers, a distinct icon makes it much faster to find the one you're looking for — no need to read every name.

To pick a new icon:

1. On the **General** tab, click the **Server Icon** card.
2. Browse the icon grid and select one that fits your server.
3. Click **Save**.

There's a solid selection to choose from, including: cube, globe, gamepad, server, rocket, star, heart, bolt, shield, crown, flag, cloud, moon, leaf, sword, box, wrench, and gear.

{: .info}
> Try matching the icon to your server's purpose. A sword for a PvP server, a leaf for a nature-themed survival world, a wrench for a test server — whatever helps you spot it quickly.

## Crash Notifications
Nobody wants their server to go down without knowing about it. Crash notifications let you control whether you get alerted when a specific server crashes, so you can jump in and fix things before your players even notice.

To configure this:

1. On the **General** tab, find the **Crash Notifications** dropdown.
2. Choose one of the following options:

- **Use global setting** — This is the default. Your server will follow whatever notification preference you've set at the account level. If you haven't customized anything, this is what you want.
- **Always notify** — No matter what your global setting says, you'll always receive crash notifications for this particular server. This is great for your most important or production servers where downtime really matters.
- **Never notify** — Crash notifications will be silenced for this server, regardless of your global preference. This can be useful for test servers or servers you're experimenting with, where crashes are expected and you don't need the extra noise.

{: .info}
> This is a per-server setting, meaning it overrides your account-wide notification preference for just this server. Your other servers are not affected.

## Wrapping Up
Taking a minute or two to set up a clear name, a helpful description, a recognizable icon, and the right notification preference for each of your servers makes managing them so much easier down the road. It's a small investment that pays off every time you open your server list.
