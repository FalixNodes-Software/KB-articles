Ready to get your server up and running? Here's how to create your first server on Falix. The whole process only takes a minute or two, and you'll be up and playing before you know it.

## Creating the Server

1. Log in to the [Dashboard](https://client.falixnodes.net/).

2. In the navigation menu, click on [Create Server](https://client.falixnodes.net/create).

3. Choose the server type that works best for you:
    - **Free** -- a great way to get started at no cost. You'll have access to Minecraft and Hytale servers with generous resources to try things out.
    - **Premium** -- unlocks additional games, applications, and extra server resources for a more powerful experience. For a detailed walkthrough of the premium checkout process, see [How To Purchase a Premium Server](falix/account/billing/purchasing-server).

4. Click **Continue** to proceed.

> If you already have a premium plan, this step is skipped and you'll go straight to entering your server details.

### Enter Server Details

Now you'll give your server a name and an address. Fill in the following:

- **Server Name**: This is how your server will appear in your dashboard (3-20 characters). Don't worry about picking the perfect name right now -- you can change it at any time.

- **Server Domain**: This is the address your players will type in to connect to your server (1-20 characters, lowercase letters only). You can also pick a domain suffix from the dropdown. Like the server name, this can be changed later if you change your mind.

Once you're happy with your choices, click **Continue**.

### Select the Game or Application

1. Choose the game you'd like to run on your server.
    - Free users can select **Minecraft** and **Hytale**.
    - Premium users get access to a wider selection of games and applications. You can browse the full list of available software [here](/falix/dashboard/setup/supported-software).

2. Continue to the next page.

### Review and Create the Server

You're almost there! Take a moment to double-check everything before you finalize.

1. A **Summary** page will appear showing all the details you've selected.

2. Review the information and make sure everything looks right.

3. If you're installing a Minecraft server, you'll need to accept the **[Minecraft End User License Agreement (EULA)](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/eula)**.

4. When you're ready, click "**Create**{: .green }" to bring your server to life.

{: .success}
> If everything went smoothly, you'll see a popup message: **"Your server has been created successfully."** Congratulations -- your server is officially born!

## Accessing Your Server

1. Head back to the [Dashboard](https://client.falixnodes.net/).

2. Scroll down to your server list.

3. Click on your newly created server to open the [Console](https://client.falixnodes.net/server/).

{: .success}
> Your server is now ready! From the console, you can start it up, monitor activity, and manage everything in one place.

## Next Steps

Now that your server is live, here are a few things you might want to do next:

- **Install or change your server version** -- Whether you want the latest release or a specific version, head over to **[How to Install or Change Your Server Version](/minecraft/java/setup/server-version)** to get set up.
- **Invite your friends** -- Share your server domain with friends so they can join and start playing with you right away.
- **Add plugins or mods** -- Customize your server with plugins and mods to make the experience truly your own.
- **Configure your server settings** -- Tweak gameplay options, difficulty, and more to set the perfect vibe for your community.
- **Set up backups** -- Protect your hard work by enabling backups so you never lose progress.

Have fun building something awesome -- and welcome to Falix!
