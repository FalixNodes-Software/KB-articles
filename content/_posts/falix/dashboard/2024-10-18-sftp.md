## What Is SFTP?

SFTP, or **S**ecure **F**ile **T**ransfer **P**rotocol, ensures secure file access, transfer, and management over an encrypted data stream. Meaning you are able to manage files remotely through an external SFTP client without having to access the [Dashboard](https://client.falixnodes.net/).

> Although, depending on your SFTP client, you may have access to features such as sorting, filtering, file synchronization, and properties, it is still recommended to use the Dashboard as it contains a recycle bin and is much faster than SFTP.

## Choosing a SFTP Client:

| SFTP client                                                                            | Supported platforms       |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| [Filezilla](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?type=client)                    | Windows, MacOS, and Linux |
| [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/download/)                                            | Windows and MacOS         |
| [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/download.php)                                          | Windows                   |
| [AndFTP](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=lysesoft.andftp&hl=en_US&gl=US) | Android                   |
| [FTPManager](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ftpmanager-ftp-sftp-client/id525959186)     | IOS                       |

## Establishing a SFTP Connection to Your Server:

### Finding Your SFTP Credentials:

1. Log in to the [Dashboard](https://client.falixnodes.net/).

2. Choose a server within your server list.

3. You will be redirected to the [Console Page](https://client.falixnodes.net/server/console) of your server. In the navigation menu, open the "Server Settings" category and navigate to the [SFTP](https://client.falixnodes.net/server/sftp) page.

4. Under "SFTP Details", take a note of your SFTP details.

    ![SFTP Details](/content/assets/images/posts/sftp/sftp-details.png)

{: .warning}

> Do **NOT** share your SFTP credentials with anyone unless you absolutely trust them. These credentials will allow **anyone** to access and delete your files.

> If you wish to reset your SFTP password, you may do so by clicking on "**Change Password**{: .blue }" under "Danger Zone" in the [Settings page](https://client.falixnodes.net/profile/settings).

### Connecting With Your SFTP Client:

1. Launch your SFTP client.

2. Follow the table below and input your credentials in the appropriate fields:

| SFTP details | Description                                                                                               |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Protocol     | Make sure it is **always** set to `SFTP`.                                                                 |
| Host-name    | The string of characters between `sftp://` and the colon (`:`). It should resemble `xxx.falixserver.net`. |
| Port         | The string of numbers after the colon (`:`).                                                              |
| User-name    | Your SFTP user.                                                                                           |
| Password:    | Your SFTP password.                                                                                       |

> An alternate but easier option would be to click on "Launch SFTP" in the dashboard and inputting your SFTP password, however this only works on some devices.
