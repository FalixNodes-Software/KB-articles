The external start feature is a great way to allow players or users to start your server when needed without needing access to your server's console.

## :flashlight: Toggling the External Start Feature:

1. Log in to the [Dashboard](https://client.falixnodes.net/).

2. Navigate to your [Profile Settings](https://client.falixnodes.net/profile/settings) by clicking the user icon in the top navigation bar then clicking on "Settings".

3. Look for the "External Server Start" dropdown under "Server Settings" and click it to expand it.

4. Select "Enable" to enable the feature across all your servers or "Disable" to disable it altogether.

5. Click on "**Update**{: .blue }" to apply your changes.

{: .warning}

> Server owners and admins are **not** allowed to use this feature, please use the console instead.

1. Go to the [External Start page](https://falixnodes.net/startserver).

2. Enter the subdomain of the server you want to start; it should resemble this format: `xxxxx.falixsrv.me`.

    > You can prefill the subdomain by adding `#name=xxxxx.falixsrv.me` to the end of the page URL. Make sure to replace `xxxxx.falixsrv.me` with your actual subdomain.

3. Click on the "**Start Server**" button to initiate a server start.

{: .success}

> If successful, you should see "Server `xxxxx.falixsrv.me` has been started".

> You may have to wait a few minutes for the server to finish starting.
