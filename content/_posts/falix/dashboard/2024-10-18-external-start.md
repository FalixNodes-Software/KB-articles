The external start feature is a great way to allow players or users to start your server when needed without needing access to your server's console.

## :green_circle: Starting a Server Using External Start:
{: .warning}
> It is not allowed for server owners to use this feature, start your free server in [the console](https://client.falixnodes.net/server/console) instead.

1. Go to the [External Start page](https://falixnodes.net/startserver).

2. Enter the IP address of the server you want to start.

    > Specifying the port is not necessary.

    > you can prefill the subdomain box by adding `#name=yoursubdomain.falixsrv.me` to the end of the page url.

3. Click on the "**Start Server**{: .purple }" button to initiate a server start.

{: .success}

> If successful, you should see "Server `xxxxx.falixsrv.me` has been started".

> You may have to wait a few minutes for the server to finish starting.
