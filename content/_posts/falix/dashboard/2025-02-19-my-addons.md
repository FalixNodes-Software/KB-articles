## Introduction
The My Addons page is your one-stop hub for everything you have installed on your server. Instead of digging through the file manager to check what plugins, mods, or data packs are running, you can see them all in one organized view. From here you can check for updates, enable or disable addons on the fly, and remove anything you no longer need — all without touching individual files.

{: .info}
> Check this page regularly to keep your plugins and mods up to date. Running outdated addons can lead to bugs, security issues, or incompatibilities with newer Minecraft versions.

## Overview Statistics

At the top of the page, you will find five stat cards that give you a quick snapshot of your server's addon situation at a glance. **Plugins**, **Mods**, and **Packs** (data packs) each show how many of that type you currently have installed. The **Outdated** counter tells you how many of your addons have a newer version available, so you know right away if something needs attention. Finally, **Matched** shows how many of your addons were successfully found in the Modrinth database, which is what powers the version tracking and update features.

## Addon Listing

### Search and Filters
Finding a specific addon is straightforward. The **Search** bar lets you filter addons by name or filename in real-time as you type. You can also narrow things down with the **Type Filter** to show only plugins, only mods, or only data packs (or view all types at once). The **Status Filter** is especially handy — use it to show only outdated addons, only up-to-date ones, or to separate Modrinth-matched addons from those that were not found in the database. If things ever look out of sync, hit the **Refresh** button to reload the addon list directly from your server.

All filters work together using AND logic, so you can combine them to get exactly the view you need.

### View Modes

You can toggle between **Card View** and **List View** depending on your preference. Card View displays your addons in a 3-column grid, which is the default and gives you a nice visual overview. List View switches to compact rows if you prefer something more condensed. Whichever you choose, your preference is saved across sessions.

### Sorting

Addons are automatically sorted to put the most important items first. Outdated addons always appear at the top so you do not miss them, followed by Modrinth-matched addons before unmatched ones.

### Pagination

The page shows 12 addons at a time. Pagination controls appear at both the top and bottom of the list, making it easy to navigate no matter where you are on the page.

## Addon Cards

Each addon in the list shows you the key details you need. The **icon** is pulled from the Modrinth project page when available, or you will see a placeholder icon based on the addon type (plugin, mod, or data pack). The **name** comes from Modrinth as well, though if the addon is not matched on Modrinth, you will simply see the filename instead. For matched addons, the **current version** is displayed so you can tell exactly what you are running. You may also see **badges** on certain addons — an orange "Update Available" badge means a newer version exists, a purple "Disabled" badge means the addon is currently turned off, and a source badge indicates where the addon was installed from.

## Modrinth Integration

Behind the scenes, the system matches your installed addons against the Modrinth database using SHA512 file hashing. When a match is found, several useful features unlock:

- The addon displays its Modrinth project name and icon instead of just the filename
- Version information is shown so you know exactly what you are running
- Update detection kicks in, alerting you when newer versions are available
- Clicking the addon opens the full Modrinth detail view with descriptions, screenshots, and version history

If an addon is not found on Modrinth, do not worry — it will still appear in your list using its filename. You just will not get the version tracking or update features for that particular addon.

## Updating Addons

When a newer version of an addon is available on Modrinth, you will see an orange **Update Available** badge on the card along with an **Update** button. Clicking **Update** opens a confirmation modal so you do not accidentally update something mid-session. Once you confirm, the system deletes the current addon file, downloads the latest version to the same directory, and refreshes your addon list automatically.

{: .info}
> Update detection is smart about compatibility. It checks against your server's Minecraft version and mod loader before suggesting an update. The Bukkit family (Paper, Spigot, Bukkit, Purpur) is considered cross-compatible, Forge and NeoForge are treated as cross-compatible, and Quilt is compatible with Fabric addons.

## Enabling and Disabling Addons

Sometimes you want to temporarily turn off an addon without removing it entirely — maybe you are troubleshooting an issue or just testing a different setup. The enable/disable toggle makes this simple:

- **Disabling** an addon renames the file from `filename.jar` to `filename.jar.disabled`, which prevents the server from loading it
- **Enabling** it renames it back to `filename.jar` so the server picks it up again

Disabled addons show a purple **Disabled** badge and the card appears dimmed, so it is easy to tell what is active and what is not.

{: .warning}
> Disabling an addon is a great way to troubleshoot server problems. If an issue goes away after disabling a specific plugin or mod, you have found the culprit. You can then check for updates, look for conflicts, or replace it altogether.

## Deleting Addons

If you want to permanently remove an addon, click the delete button (the trash icon) on its card. A confirmation modal will warn you that this action cannot be undone. Once you confirm, the file is permanently deleted from your server. If you are not completely sure you want to remove something, consider disabling it first instead — that way you can always re-enable it later if you change your mind.

## Viewing Addon Details

Want to learn more about a specific addon? Click on any Modrinth-matched addon to open the full detail view. You will see the project's description, screenshots, complete version history, and other metadata — all without leaving the dashboard.
