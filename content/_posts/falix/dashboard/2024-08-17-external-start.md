The external start feature is a great way to allow players or users to start your server when needed without needing access to your server's console.

## :flashlight: Toggling the External Start Feature:

1. Log in to the [Dashboard](https://client.falixnodes.net/).

2. Navigate to your [Profile Settings](https://client.falixnodes.net/profile/settings) by clicking the user icon in the top navigation bar then clicking on "Settings".

3. Look for the "External Server Start" option under "Server Settings".

4. Select "Enable" to enable the feature across all your servers or "Disable" to disable it altogether.

5. Click on "Update" to apply your changes.
