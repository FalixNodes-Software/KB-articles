## Introduction

Plugins are one of the best things about running a Minecraft server. They let you add entirely new features without changing the game's core code -- think in-game economies, minigames, anti-cheat protection, world management, custom chat formatting, permissions systems, and so much more. Whether you want a chill survival server with land claims or a competitive PvP arena with leaderboards, plugins are how you make it happen.

The **Plugins** page on the dashboard lets you browse thousands of plugins, search by name or category, and install them to your server with a single click. No need to manually download files or drag them into folders.

{: .info}
> The Plugins page is available for **Minecraft Java**, **Minecraft Bedrock**, **PocketMine**, **Terraria**, and **Hytale** servers.

## Browsing Plugins

### Searching for Plugins

Just start typing a plugin name into the search bar and results will appear automatically as you type. The page shows 9 plugins at a time, so you can page through results if there are a lot of matches.

Not sure what you are looking for? Try searching for broad terms like "economy," "permissions," or "world protection" to explore what is available.

### Sources

Plugins are pulled from different platforms depending on your server type. Here is what each server type has access to:

{% tabs sources %}

{% tab sources Java %}

Java server plugins are aggregated from multiple sources:

| Source | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Modrinth** | Modern modding platform |
| **Spigot** | The largest Minecraft plugin repository |
| **Hangar** | PaperMC's official plugin repository |
| **Bukkit (CurseForge)** | Classic Bukkit plugins hosted on CurseForge |

Results from all four sources are combined, deduplicated, and sorted into a single clean list so you never see the same plugin twice.

{% endtab %}

{% tab sources Bedrock %}

Bedrock servers have a source selector at the top of the page:

| Source | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Bedrock Addons** | Bedrock Edition addon packs |
| **Scripts** | Bedrock scripting API scripts |

{% endtab %}

{% tab sources PocketMine %}

PocketMine servers use plugins from the **Poggit** registry (`.phar` format).

{% endtab %}

{% tab sources Terraria %}

Terraria servers browse mods from the **Terraria** mod registry.

{% endtab %}

{% tab sources Hytale %}

Hytale servers browse addons from the **Hytale** addon registry.

{% endtab %}

{% endtabs %}

### Filtering Your Results

If browsing feels too broad, click the **filter button** to narrow things down. You can combine any of these filters to zero in on exactly what you need:

- **Sort By** -- Choose between Relevance, Downloads (the default), Follows, Newest, or Recently Updated. Sorting by downloads is a great way to find popular, well-tested plugins.
- **Categories** -- Pick from Adventure, Chat, Economy, Gameplay, Minigame, Utility, World Generation, or leave it on Any to see everything.
- **Game Version** -- This one is important. Selecting your server's specific Minecraft version helps you avoid compatibility issues.
- **Featured Only** -- Toggle this on to see only editor-picked, featured plugins.
- **Open Source Only** -- Toggle this on if you prefer plugins with publicly available source code.

{: .warning}
> Always check a plugin's supported game versions before installing. A plugin built for 1.20 might not work on a 1.21 server, and installing incompatible plugins can cause crashes or unexpected behavior.

Click **Reset Filters** to go back to the defaults at any time.

### View Modes

You can toggle between two layouts depending on your preference:

- **Card View** (the default) -- A 3-column grid showing each plugin's icon, name, author, category, description, and stats at a glance.
- **List View** -- A more compact layout with the same information arranged in rows. Great if you are scanning through a lot of results quickly.

Your view preference is saved automatically, so it will stick around between sessions.

### Pagination

Navigate between pages using the first, previous, and next buttons, or type in a specific page number to jump directly to it. You will find pagination controls at both the top and bottom of the results list.

## What You See on Each Plugin

When you are browsing, each plugin card gives you a quick snapshot of what it is: the plugin's **icon**, **name**, **author**, and **category** are front and center, along with a short **description** so you can tell at a glance what it does. Below that you will see the **download count** and **follower count** -- both useful indicators of how popular and trusted a plugin is. There is also a **last updated** timestamp so you can avoid plugins that have not been maintained in a while.

{: .info}
> As a general rule, plugins with high download counts and recent updates are the safest bet. A plugin that was last updated years ago may not work with newer Minecraft versions.

## Plugin Details

Click on any plugin to open a detailed view with three tabs:

### Overview

This is where you get the full picture. You will find the plugin's complete description, author information, download and follower stats, and a rating if one is available. If the plugin depends on other plugins (for example, many plugins require Vault for economy support), those dependencies are listed here too. You will also find links to external resources like the plugin's source code, wiki, or Discord server -- handy if you need help configuring it.

### Gallery

Some plugin authors include screenshots and images showing off their plugin in action. If available, you can browse them here.

### Versions

This tab shows every available release of the plugin (20 per page) and lets you filter by:

- **Platform** -- Paper, Spigot, Purpur, and other supported server software
- **Game Version** -- Lock results to your specific Minecraft version
- **Version Type** -- Choose between Release, Beta, or Alpha builds

Each version entry shows its version number, release date, compatible game versions, and an **Install** button.

{: .info}
> Stick with **Release** versions unless you have a specific reason to use a Beta or Alpha build. Stable releases are much less likely to have bugs.

## Installing Plugins

Installing a plugin is straightforward: find the version you want and click **Install**. The plugin file is placed directly into your server's `/plugins` directory -- no manual file management needed.

How the download works behind the scenes depends on where the plugin comes from:

- **Modrinth** plugins are downloaded from the Modrinth CDN.
- **Spigot** plugins are downloaded via the Spiget API.
- **Hangar** plugins are downloaded from the Hangar API. If a plugin supports multiple platforms (like Paper and Velocity), you will be asked to choose which one you need.
- **Bukkit (CurseForge)** plugins are downloaded from the CurseForge API.
- **GitHub-hosted** versions may contain multiple JAR files -- if so, a file selection dialog will pop up so you can pick the right one.

You will see a notification confirming the plugin was installed successfully.

{: .warning}
> After installing a new plugin, you will need to restart your server (or run `/reload confirm` if the plugin supports it) for the plugin to take effect.

## Popular Plugin Recommendations

If you are just getting started, here are some widely-used plugins worth checking out:

- **EssentialsX** -- A must-have for most servers. Adds homes, warps, kits, economy, and dozens of utility commands.
- **LuckPerms** -- The go-to permissions plugin. Control exactly what each player or group can do.
- **Vault** -- An API that connects economy, permissions, and chat plugins together. Many plugins require it.
- **WorldGuard** -- Protect regions of your world from griefing and configure area-specific rules.
- **GriefPrevention** -- Let players claim land to protect their builds. Great for survival servers.

## Free Plan Restrictions

If you are on the free plan, there are a couple of limitations to be aware of:

- Only Spigot plugins with **100+ downloads** are shown in search results. This filters out very new or untested plugins.
- Certain categories of potentially abusive plugins are blocked, including:
  - Fake player plugins (FakePlayerOnline, ReallyFakePlayers, PlayerDoll, etc.)
  - MOTD manipulation plugins (ServerListPlus, MiniMOTD, AdvancedMOTD, etc.)
  - Player count modifier plugins (FakeSlots, SlotJoiner, etc.)
  - World pre-generation plugins (Chunky, ChunkMaster, etc.)

Upgrading to Premium removes all of these restrictions, giving you full access to every plugin.

{: .info}
> To see which plugins are currently installed on your server, check the [My Addons](/falix/dashboard/content/my-addons) page. It shows all your installed plugins, mods, and data packs in one place, with update checking and version tracking powered by Modrinth.
