## Introduction

Your server doesn't have to be a one-world deal. Maybe you want a survival world for everyday play, a creative world for building projects, and a pre-built adventure map ready to go for weekends with friends. The Worlds page makes all of that possible -- you can create, upload, download, rename, delete, and switch between as many worlds as you need, all without losing any data.

{: .info}
> You can have multiple worlds on the same server and switch between them at any time. Each world keeps its own data, so nothing gets overwritten when you swap.

## World Listing

Every world on your server shows up as its own card. At a glance, you can see the world name (with a link to the map viewer for Java worlds), which world is currently active (marked with a crown **Primary** badge), the edition it belongs to (Java, Bedrock, or Hytale), and its directory path. Each card also has a row of action buttons depending on the world's status:

- **Primary worlds** show: Settings, Map (Java only), Files, Download, Datapacks (Java only), Rename, and a locked Protected button (since the primary world can't be deleted).
- **Secondary worlds** show: Make Primary, Settings, Map (Java only), Files, Download, Datapacks (Java only), Rename, and Delete.

{: .info}
> World data is cached for up to one hour. If you've made changes outside the dashboard (like uploading via FTP), click the refresh button in the top-right corner to force a fresh scan.

## Switching the Primary World

The primary world is the one your server actually loads when it starts up -- think of it as the "active" world. It's marked with a crown badge so you can spot it right away.

To change which world is active, just click **Make Primary** on any other world card. This automatically updates the `level-name` in server.properties (or the equivalent config for Bedrock and Hytale servers), so you don't have to dig through config files yourself.

{: .info}
> The primary world cannot be deleted. If you want to remove it, switch to a different primary world first.

## Creating a World

{: .info}
> World generation is only available for **Minecraft Java** servers.

Click **Generate New World** to open the generation form. Here are the options you can configure:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **World Name** | Letters, numbers, spaces, hyphens, and underscores |
| **Seed** | Optional numeric or text seed |
| **World Type** | Normal, Flat, Large Biomes, or Amplified |
| **Generate Structures** | Villages, temples, dungeons, etc. |
| **Game Mode** | Survival, Creative, Adventure, or Spectator |
| **Difficulty** | Peaceful, Easy, Normal, or Hard |
| **Spawn Protection Radius** | Default: 16 blocks |
| **World Border Size** | Default: 29,999,984 blocks |
| **Generator Settings** | Advanced JSON settings (optional) |

Once you hit generate, here's what happens behind the scenes:

1. The server starts with temporary settings.
2. The world generates for about 30 seconds.
3. The server stops automatically.
4. You're prompted to set the new world as primary if you'd like.

If a world with that name already exists, you'll get the option to either replace it or pick a different name -- so there's no risk of accidentally overwriting something.

{: .info}
> Got a specific seed from a friend or a website? Paste it into the **Seed** field during creation to generate that exact world layout.

## Uploading a World

Already have a world you want to bring over? Maybe it's a backup, a friend's survival world, or a pre-built adventure map you downloaded. There are a few ways to upload depending on your situation.

{% tabs upload %}

{% tab upload Folder %}

Upload a complete world folder straight from your computer. The entire directory structure, including all subfolders, is preserved during the upload.

{% endtab %}

{% tab upload Archive %}

Upload your world as a `.zip`, `.rar`, or `.7z` archive. It gets extracted automatically after the upload finishes, so you don't need to unzip anything beforehand.

{% endtab %}

{% tab upload Bedrock (.mcworld) %}

Running a Bedrock server? There's a dedicated upload option just for `.mcworld` files. Once uploaded, the world is automatically installed and set as your primary world.

The upload modal also includes a step-by-step guide with links to popular world sources like CurseForge and MCPEDL.

{% endtab %}

{% endtabs %}

{: .info}
> Upload a pre-built adventure map for your friends -- it's a great way to try something new without starting from scratch.

## Downloading a World

Want to back up a world or share it with someone? Click the **Download** button on any world card and the entire world folder will be archived and downloaded to your computer. It's a good idea to do this regularly, especially before making big changes.

## Renaming a World

Click the **Rename** button to change a world's folder name. You can use letters, numbers, spaces, hyphens, and underscores.

If you rename the primary world, the `level-name` in server.properties gets updated automatically so your server still loads the right world on startup.

{: .warning}
> Nether and End dimension folders (like `worldname_nether` and `worldname_the_end`) are not automatically renamed. If you rename your main world folder, those dimension folders will still have the old name. This usually doesn't cause issues, but keep it in mind.

## Deleting a World

Click the **Delete**{: .red } button on any secondary world card. You'll need to type "DELETE" to confirm, so there's no chance of accidentally removing something important.

{: .warning}
> Deleting a world only removes the main world folder. Associated Nether and End dimension folders (like `worldname_nether` and `worldname_the_end`) are not automatically deleted. You may want to remove those manually through the file manager if you no longer need them.

### Mass Deletion

Need to clear out several worlds at once? Select multiple worlds using the checkboxes on each card, then click **Delete**{: .red } in the floating action bar that appears. A confirmation dialog will show you a list of everything you've selected and ask you to type "DELETE" before proceeding. You can also use the **Select All** checkbox in the action bar to quickly select every world.

## Discovering Maps

{: .info}
> Map discovery is available for **Minecraft Java** and **Minecraft Bedrock** servers, but not Hytale.

Don't feel like building from scratch? You can browse and install pre-made maps from CurseForge right from the Worlds page -- no need to leave the dashboard.

Use the search bar to find maps by name, and switch between card view or list view depending on your preference. Results are paginated with 9 maps per page, and you can jump to a specific page using the "Go to" input in the pagination controls. Each listing shows the map name, author, download count, last updated date, and categories so you can get a good sense of what you're installing. You can even select multiple maps and install them all at once if you want to stock up.

To add a map to your server, just click **Install** on any listing and it'll be downloaded and added automatically.

## Datapacks

{: .info}
> Datapacks are only available for **Minecraft Java** servers.

Datapacks let you customize world behavior -- things like custom recipes, loot tables, advancements, and more. Click **Datapacks** on a world card to manage them. The modal has three sections:

- **Browse** -- Opens the built-in datapack browser where you can discover and install datapacks from external sources.
- **Upload** -- Drag and drop a `.zip` file onto the upload area to install a datapack directly.
- **Installed list** -- See all currently installed datapacks with their name, size, and a delete button for each. Use the refresh button to update the list after making changes.

At the bottom of the modal, you'll also find a **File Manager** link that jumps straight to the datapacks folder for manual management.

## World Settings

Click **Settings** on any world card to open the [World Settings](/falix/dashboard/content/world-settings) page for that world. From there, you can configure game rules, time, weather, spawning, and much more.

## World Map Viewer

{: .info}
> The map viewer is only available for **Minecraft Java** worlds.

Want a bird's-eye view of your world? Click the map icon next to a Java world's name to open a visual map viewer that renders the world's region data. It's a handy way to get a sense of the terrain and see what's been explored.
