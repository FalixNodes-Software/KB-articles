## What Is SFTP?

SFTP, or **S**ecure **F**ile **T**ransfer **P**rotocol, ensures secure file access, transfer, and management over an encrypted data stream. This means you can manage your server files remotely through an external SFTP client without needing to use the [Dashboard](https://client.falixnodes.net/) file manager.

{: .info}
> Although your SFTP client may offer features like sorting, filtering, file synchronization, and file properties, it is still recommended to use the Dashboard file manager when possible. The Dashboard provides a recycle bin for deleted files and is generally faster than SFTP for everyday tasks.

## Prerequisites

Before you can use SFTP, you need to have a **username** and **password** set on your account. If you do not have a username set, you will be prompted to create one on the SFTP page. If you do not have a password set, you will be redirected to the Settings page to create one.

## Finding Your SFTP Credentials

1. Log in to the [Dashboard](https://client.falixnodes.net/).
2. Choose a server from your server list.
3. In the navigation menu, open the "Advanced" category and navigate to the [SFTP](https://client.falixnodes.net/server/sftp) page.
4. On the SFTP page, you will see your connection details:
   - **SFTP Address** -- the full address including the host and port (e.g., `sftp://xxx.falixserver.net:2022`). Click the copy button to copy it.
   - **Username** -- your SFTP username in the format `yourname.serverid`. Click the copy button to copy it.

{: .info}
> Your SFTP password is the same as your dashboard account password. If you need to reset it, you can do so in the [Settings page](https://client.falixnodes.net/profile/settings).

### Launch SFTP Connection

If your computer has an SFTP client set as the default handler for `sftp://` links, you can click the **Launch SFTP Connection**{: .blue } button to open the connection directly in your client. You will still need to enter your password manually.

{: .warning}
> Do **NOT** share your SFTP credentials with anyone unless you absolutely trust them. These credentials will allow **anyone** to access and delete your files.

## SSH Keys

Instead of entering your password every time you connect, you can add SSH public keys to your account for passwordless authentication. SSH keys are more secure than passwords and much more convenient if you connect frequently.

### Adding an SSH Key

1. On the SFTP page, scroll down to the **SSH Keys** section.
2. Click **Add SSH Key**{: .blue }.
3. Enter a **name** for the key (something descriptive like "My Laptop" or "Work PC").
4. Paste your **public key** into the text area. This is usually the contents of your `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` or `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` file.
5. Click **Add Key**{: .blue }.

{: .info}
> If you have two-factor authentication enabled on your account, you will be prompted to enter your 2FA code before adding or deleting SSH keys.

### Deleting an SSH Key

Each SSH key in the list shows its name, fingerprint, and the date it was added. Click the **Delete**{: .red } button next to any key to remove it. You will be asked to confirm before the key is deleted.
