## Introduction
Things go wrong. Maybe a plugin update corrupts your world, a griefer slips through, or you accidentally delete the wrong folder at 2 AM. Backups are your safety net -- they let you roll back to a known-good state in minutes instead of starting over from scratch. With Falix, you can create manual backups whenever you want, and if you're on a premium node, automatic hourly backups run in the background so you're always covered.

You can manage all of your backups from the dedicated **Backups** page or directly through the **File Manager** -- whichever feels more convenient.

{: .info}
> Create a backup before installing modpacks, updating plugins, or making any big changes to your server. It only takes a moment and can save you hours of frustration.

## Creating a Backup

{% tabs create %}

{% tab create From Backups Page %}

1. Navigate to your server's **Backups** page.
2. Click **Create Backup**.
3. Configure your backup options (see below).
4. Click **Create Backup**.

{% endtab %}

{% tab create From File Manager %}

1. Open the **File Manager** on your server.
2. Navigate to the **Backups** section (`.backups` directory).
3. Click **Create Backup**.
4. Configure your backup options (see below).
5. Click **Create Backup**.

{% endtab %}

{% endtabs %}

The backup will appear in your list with a spinner while it's being created. Once it finishes, all actions become available.

### Backup Options

When creating a backup, you have a few choices:

- **Backup Name** -- You can give it a descriptive name (like "before-modpack-install"), or leave it blank and a timestamp-based name will be generated for you.
- **Selective File Backup** -- Instead of backing up your entire server, pick only the specific files and folders you need. Great for saving just your world data or config files.
- **Lock Backup** -- Locking a backup prevents it from being deleted, transferred, or auto-removed when your quota fills up. Think of it as pinning an important snapshot in place.

{: .info}
> Lock important backups so they don't get auto-deleted. If your backup quota fills up, the oldest unlocked backup is removed to make room -- but locked backups are always safe.

### Selective File Backup

When you enable selective file backup, a file picker opens up where you can:

- Navigate your server's directory structure
- Select individual files or entire folders with checkboxes
- Use the **Select All** checkbox for the current directory
- View a running count of selected items in a floating panel
- Remove individual items from your selection before creating

You'll see a confirmation step showing all selected paths before the backup begins.

{: .info}
> If you don't enable selective file backup, the entire server is backed up.

### Limits

| Rule | Value |
|------|-------|
| Rate limit | Maximum 2 backups per 10 minutes |
| Backup quota | Depends on your plan (shown as a progress bar on the page) |
| Auto-deletion | When your quota is full, the oldest **unlocked** backup is automatically deleted to make room |

{: .warning}
> Servers in storage mode cannot create backups.

## Auto Backups

If your server is on a premium plan and running on a premium node, you get automatic hourly backups -- no action required on your part. These show up under the **Auto Backups** tab on the backups page.

### How They Work

- The system creates a new backup every hour, automatically
- Backups are grouped by date (Today, Yesterday, older dates) so it's easy to find what you need
- Each date group is collapsible to keep things tidy
- Results are paginated at 24 backups per page

### Auto Backup Actions

For each auto backup, you can:

- **Download** -- Save the backup to your computer
- **Restore** -- Run a full restore with an optional "delete existing files first" step
- **View Files** -- Browse the backup's contents right in the file manager


## Browsing Backup Contents

Want to check what's inside a backup before restoring it? You can peek inside any backup without actually restoring anything.

{: .info}
> Browsing backup contents through the File Manager is a premium feature. Free users can still create, download, restore, and manage backups from the Backups page.

{% tabs browse %}

{% tab browse From File Manager %}

1. Open the **File Manager** on your server.
2. Navigate to the **Backups** section (`.backups` directory).
3. Your manual and auto backups are listed with their name, size, and creation date.
4. Click a backup to browse its contents.

{% endtab %}

{% tab browse From Auto Backups %}

1. Navigate to the **Auto Backups** tab on the Backups page.
2. Click the **View Files** button (folder icon) on any auto backup.
3. The file manager opens showing that backup's directory structure.

{% endtab %}

{% tab browse Right-Click Menu %}

In the File Manager's backups list, right-click a backup to access:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Browse | View the backup's file contents |
| Restore | Open the restore options modal |
| Download | Download the backup file |
| Lock / Unlock | Toggle deletion protection (manual backups only) |
| Delete | Remove the backup (disabled if locked, manual backups only) |

{% endtab %}

{% endtabs %}

When browsing backup contents:

- A breadcrumb trail shows your path: **Server > Backups > Backup Name > Current Path**
- Navigate through folders by clicking them
- View file names, sizes, and modification dates
- Select files using checkboxes for bulk actions
- The mass action bar shows **Copy to Server**, **Select All**, and **Deselect All** buttons

{: .info}
> If the backup is still being indexed, you'll see a "Backup is being indexed..." message. The page automatically checks every 30 seconds until indexing is complete.

## Restoring from a Backup

There are four ways to get data back from a backup, depending on whether you need everything or just a few files.

{% tabs restore %}

{% tab restore Full Restore %}

Replaces your entire server with the backup contents.

1. Click **Restore** on the backup (from the Backups page, File Manager, or right-click menu).
2. Select **Full Restore**.
3. Optionally enable **Delete files before restore** to remove all existing server files first.
4. Type **RESTORE** in the confirmation field.
5. Click **Restore**.

Your server's status will change to "restoring" until the process completes.

{: .warning}
> Full restore overwrites your current server data. Create a backup of your current state first if you want to preserve it.

{% endtab %}

{% tab restore Selective Restore %}

Restore specific files or folders from the backup without touching the rest of your server.

1. Click **Restore** on the backup.
2. Select **Selective Restore**.
3. The file manager opens showing the backup's contents.
4. Navigate to the files you want to restore.
5. Select files using checkboxes -- a floating panel shows the count of selected items.
6. Confirm your selection to restore the files to your server.

{: .info}
> Selective restore is only available for Wings-based backups (manual backups). Borg-based auto backups do not support selective restore.

{% endtab %}

{% tab restore Copy to Server %}

Copy specific files from a backup into a chosen location on your live server.

1. Browse a backup's contents in the File Manager.
2. Select the files you want to copy using checkboxes.
3. Click **Copy to Server** in the mass action bar.
4. A modal opens showing the count of selected files.
5. Browse or type the destination path on your live server.
6. Optionally create a new folder at the destination using the folder button.
7. Optionally enable **Overwrite existing files**.
8. Click **Copy**.

After copying, the file manager navigates to the destination folder and shows how many files were copied.

{% endtab %}

{% tab restore Quick Restore %}

A two-step wizard for restoring specific files from your live server's file manager.

**Step 1 -- Select a Backup:**
1. In the **File Manager**, right-click a file or select multiple files.
2. Choose **Quick Restore**.
3. A list of your completed manual backups appears (only Wings-based backups are shown).
4. Select which backup to restore from.
5. Click **Next**.

**Step 2 -- Confirm:**
1. Review the selected backup name and the list of file paths that will be restored.
2. Click **Restore**.

The selected files are restored from the backup and the current directory reloads.

{: .warning}
> Quick restore overwrites the current version of the selected files without confirmation beyond the wizard. Make sure you've selected the correct backup.

{% endtab %}

{% endtabs %}

## Managing Backups

### Downloading

Click the **Download** button on any backup to generate a time-limited download URL. The backup file will be saved to your computer.

### Locking and Unlocking

Locking a backup protects it from being deleted, transferred, or automatically removed when your quota is full. A locked backup displays a lock badge next to its name so you can tell at a glance. Unlocked backups have no such protection and can be freely deleted, transferred, or auto-removed.

To toggle the lock state, click the **Lock** or **Unlock** button on a backup. You'll find this on the Backups page, in the File Manager backups list, and in the right-click context menu.

{: .info}
> Lock important backups so they don't get auto-deleted. This is especially useful for milestones -- like right after a successful event or a big build session.

### Transferring to Another Server

You can move a backup from one server to another without downloading and re-uploading it.

1. Click the **Transfer** button on an unlocked backup.
2. A list of your other servers appears showing each server's name, node, and current backup count.
3. Select the destination server.
4. Confirm the transfer.

**Transfer requirements:**
- The backup must be unlocked
- You must own both the source and destination servers
- The destination server cannot be in storage mode
- The destination server must have room in its backup quota

### Deleting

{% tabs delete %}

{% tab delete Single Backup %}

1. Click the **Delete** button on an unlocked backup.
2. Type the exact backup name in the confirmation field.
3. Confirm the deletion.

{% endtab %}

{% tab delete Multiple Backups %}

From the File Manager's backups list:

1. Select multiple backups using checkboxes.
2. Click **Delete** in the mass action bar.
3. Confirm the deletion.

{: .info}
> The delete button is disabled if any selected backup is locked. Unlock them first.

{% endtab %}

{% endtabs %}

{: .warning}
> Locked backups cannot be deleted. Unlock the backup first if you need to remove it.
