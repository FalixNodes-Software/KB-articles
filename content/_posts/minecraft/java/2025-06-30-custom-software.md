Before proceeding with this guide, we recommend reading our [server software guide](/minecraft/java/general/server-software) to better understand the terms used below.

Often a user will want to use a specific version or software, either because of a modpack requirement or for specific features. Fortunately, this can be easily done with a custom jar. Custom jars come in two forms: a standalone `.jar` file, or a `.jar` file, a library folder and sometimes other files.

Please be aware that we are not affiliated with any of the third-party tools mentioned below. Use them at your own discretion.

Some installation processes (like NeoForge and Spigot) might require you to have a Java JRE/JDK package installed. You can find downloads for Java 21 [here](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?os=any&arch=any&version=21).
