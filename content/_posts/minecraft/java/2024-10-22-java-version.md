Java is the programming language the Java edition of Minecraft is built on; it is what powers this edition and allows it to run. And as such, it is very important to use the correct version corresponding to your server software and version. Fortunately, this is automatically configured if you use the built-in version installer in the dashboard. However, if you use a custom jar or if a mod or plugin requires a different version, you will need to manually adjust it.

1. Log in to the [Dashboard](https://client.falixnodes.net/).

2. Choose a server within your server list.

3. You will be redirected to your server's [Console page](https://client.falixnodes.net/server/console). Ensure your server is turned off by clicking the "**Stop**{: .red }" button above the console.

4. In the top navigation bar, hover over "Manage" then click on [Settings](https://client.falixnodes.net/server/settings).

5. Under the "Environment" dropdown, select the corresponding Java version according to your server version.

    | Server version          | Java version |
    | ----------------------- | ------------ |
    | 1.12 or below           | Java 8       |
    | Between 1.13 and 1.16   | Java 11      |
    | 1.17                    | Java 16      |
    | Between 1.18 and 1.20.4 | Java 17      |
    | 1.20.5 or above         | Java 21      |

6. Click on "**Update**{: .green }" to save your changes.
