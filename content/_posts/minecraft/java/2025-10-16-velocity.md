### What is it?
[velocity](https://papermc.io/software/velocity) (created by the [PaperMC](https://papermc.io/team) team) is a proxy designed to seamlessly connect multiple Minecraft servers, allowing players to navigate between them without leaving the game. 

velocity is compatible with forge,, PaperMC, and any paper fork (like purpur). 

{: .note }
if you want to use velocity on fabric servers, install the [fabricproxy-lite](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabricproxy-lite) mod on the server and follow the setup instructions there on hwo to setup the fabricfallback server.

## Creating and Configuring the Proxy 
the proxy server that we are goign to set up is a seperate server then the server(s) that you want your players to join. you can learn how to create a new server [here](https://kb.falixnodes.net/falix/dashboard/server/create-server).

1. Log in to the [Dashboard](https://client.falixnodes.net/).

2. Select a server from your server list.

3. Go to the Versions page and install velocity.

4. Start your server.

{: .note }
> Do not rely on the server status at the top left of the page, it does not indicate the status of proxy servers correctly.

7. Click Stop, then click Kill.

8. In the top navigation bar, hover over "Manage", then navigate to [File Manager](https://client.falixnodes.net/server/filemanager).

9. Locate and open `velocity.toml`.

10. Scroll down to `bind = ` (line 27) and change the numbers after `:` to your velocity's port. You can find your port in the Network tab under the Advanced category. 

11. Scroll down to `player-info-forwarding-mode =  ` (line 37) and change it to `"MODERN"`

12. Scroll down to the `[servers]` section (line 72)

13. Enter the IP of the server that you want to join in the following format:

``` T
server-name = "server-IP:PORT"
```
Change `server-name` to the fallback server name (case sensitive).
Change `server-IP:PORT` to the Dynamic IP of the fallback server, you can find the Dynamic IP in the Connect tab in the console.

{: .note }
> If you have multiple fallback servers, duplicate the above code and paste it under your first server.

14. Scroll down to `try = []` (line 78) and enter the `server-name` of the server that you want your players to join when they connect.

15. Scoll down to the `[forced-hosts]` section (line 82) and delete all the examples (until you get to the `[advanced]` section).

## Preparing the fallback servers
Fallback servers are all servers connected to your Velocity proxy.

1. Login to the [Dashboard](https://client.falixnodes.net/).

2. Select a fallback server from your server list.

3. You will be redirected to the [Console Page](https://client.falixnodes.net/server/console)  of your server. In the top navigation bar, hover over "Manage", then navigate to the [File Manager](https://client.falixnodes.net/server/filemanager).

5. Open the
