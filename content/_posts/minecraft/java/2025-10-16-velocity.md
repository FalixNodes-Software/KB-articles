### What is it?
[velocity](https://papermc.io/software/velocity) (created by the [PaperMC](https://papermc.io/team) team) is a proxy designed to seamlessly connect multiple Minecraft servers, allowing players to navigate between them without leaving the game. 

velocity is compatible with forge, PaperMC, and any paper fork (like purpur). 

{: .note }
if you want to use velocity on fabric servers, install the [fabricproxy-lite](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabricproxy-lite) mod on the server and follow the setup instructions there on how to setup the fabric-fallback server.

## Creating and Configuring the Proxy 
the proxy server that we are going to set up is a separate server then the server(s) that you want your players to join. you can learn how to create a new server [here](https://kb.falixnodes.net/falix/dashboard/server/create-server).

1. Log in to the [Dashboard](https://client.falixnodes.net/).

2. Select a server from your server list.

3. Go to the Versions page and install velocity.

4. Start your server.

{: .note }
> Do not rely on the server status at the top left of the page, it does not indicate the status of proxy servers correctly.

7. Click Stop, then click Kill.

8. In the top navigation bar, hover over "Manage", then navigate to [File Manager](https://client.falixnodes.net/server/filemanager).

9. Locate and open `velocity.toml`.

10. Scroll down to `bind = ` (line 27) and change the numbers after `:` to your velocity's port. You can find your port in the Network tab under the Advanced category. 

11. Scroll down to `player-info-forwarding-mode =  ` (line 37) and change it to `"MODERN"`

12. Scroll down to the `[servers]` section (line 72)

13. Enter the IP of the server that you want to join in the following format:

``` java
server-name = "server-IP:PORT"
```
Change `server-name` to the fallback server name (case sensitive).
Change `server-IP:PORT` to the Dynamic IP of the fallback server, you can find the Dynamic IP in the Connect tab in the console.

{: .note }
> If you have multiple fallback servers, duplicate the above code and paste it under your first server.

14. Scroll down to `try = []` (line 78) and enter the `server-name` of the server that you want your players to join when they connect.

15. Scroll down to the `[forced-hosts]` section (line 82) and delete all the examples (until you get to the `[advanced]` section).

16. Save the file and go back to the [File Manager](https://client.falixnodes.net/server/filemanager).

17. Open the `forwarding.secret` file

18. Copy the contents and save it for later, this acts as a password your fallback servers need to prove their Identity

19. Go back to the console and start the server.

## Preparing the fallback servers
Fallback servers are all servers connected to your Velocity proxy.

1. Login to the [Dashboard](https://client.falixnodes.net/).

2. Select a fallback server from your server list.

3. You will be redirected to the [Console Page](https://client.falixnodes.net/server/console)  of your server. In the top navigation bar, hover over "Manage", then navigate to the [File Manager](https://client.falixnodes.net/server/filemanager).

4. Open the `/config/` folder and edit the `paper-global.yml`.

5. Scroll down to the `velocity:` section (line 111).

6. Change `enabled:` to `true`.

7. Paste the forwarding.secret key in between the `''` of `secret:` (line 114).
> If you didn't save the forwarding.secret key yet, go back to step 18 of configuring the proxy

8. Save the file and go back to the [File Manager](https://client.falixnodes.net/server/filemanager).

9. Open the `server.properties` file.

10. change `online-mode` to `false` (line 38).

11. Save the File and start the server

> Repeat this process for every fallback server that you want.

## Velocity Commands
A list of Velocity commands can be found [here](https://docs.papermc.io/velocity/built-in-commands).

### In Game
Players, including you (of course), can easily teleport to the other servers on your network by using the `/server` command in game. They can then use their cursor to click on the server they want to go to. You can also do `/server <name>`, like `/server lobby`.

This command requires the `velocity.command.server` permission, which is granted to everyone by default.
