### What is it?
[Velocity](https://papermc.io/software/velocity) (created by the [PaperMC](https://papermc.io/team) team) is a proxy designed to seamlessly connect multiple Minecraft servers, allowing players to navigate between them without leaving the game. 

Velocity is compatible with Forge, PaperMC, and any paper fork (such as Purpur). 

{: .note }
If you want to use Velocity on fabric servers, install the [fabricproxy-lite](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabricproxy-lite) mod on the server and follow the setup instructions there to set up the Fabric fallback server.


## Creating and Configuring the Proxy 
The proxy server that we are going to set up is a separate server from the server(s) that you want your players to join. you can learn how to create a new server [here](https://kb.falixnodes.net/falix/dashboard/server/create-server).


1. Login to the [Dashboard](https://client.falixnodes.net/).

2. Choose a server from your server list.

3. Go to the Versions page and install Velocity.

4. Launch your server.

{: .note }
> Do not rely on the server status at the top left of the page, it does not correctly indicate the status of proxy servers.

7. Click Stop, then click Kill.

8. In the top navigation bar, hover over "Manage", and then navigate to [File Manager](https://client.falixnodes.net/server/filemanager).

9. Locate and open `velocity.toml`.

10. Scroll down to `bind = ` (line 27) and change the numbers after `:` to your Velocity port. You can find your port on the Network tab in the Advanced category. 


11. Scroll down to `player-info-forwarding-mode = ` (line 37) and change it to:
     `MODERN` if all your servers are 1.13 or above.
     `LEGACY` if you have servers below 1.13.
     `bungeeguard` if you have the bungeegaurd plugin installed on your servers, more info on bungeeguard [here](https://github.com/lucko/BungeeGuard/blob/master/INSTALLATION.md).
     `NONE`  if you don't want to forward player info.
     You can find more info on player info forwarding [here](https://docs.papermc.io/velocity/player-information-forwarding)

12. Scroll down to the `[servers]` section (line 72).

13. Enter the IP of the server you want to join in the following format.


``` java
server-name = "server-IP:PORT"
```
Change `server-name' to the fallback server name (case sensitive).
Change `server-IP:PORT' to the dynamic IP of the fallback server, you can find the dynamic IP in the Connect tab in the console.

{: .note }
> If you have multiple fallback servers, duplicate the above code and paste it under your first server.

14. Scroll down to `try = []` (line 78) and enter the `server-name` of the server you want your players to join when they connect.

15. Scroll down to the `[forced-hosts]` section (line 82) 

> Forced Hosts are a way to have multiple domains (like survival.testserver.falixsrv.me and oneblock.testserver.falixsrv) automatically redirected to another server, overriding the default server we set in the previous step. if you are interested in using this feature, please follow [this](https://docs.papermc.io/velocity/configuration#forced-hosts-section) guide, you can create multiple .falixsrv.me subdomains in the [subdomains page](https://client.falixnodes.net/server/subdomains).

if you aren't interested in this feature, just delete all examples (until you get to the `[advanced]` section).

16. Save the file and go back to the [File Manager](https://client.falixnodes.net/server/filemanager).

17. Open the `forwarding.secret` file.

18. Copy the contents and save it for later, this will act as a password that your fallback servers will need to prove their identity.

19. Go back to the console and restart the server.

## Preparing the fallback servers
Fallback servers are any servers connected to your Velocity proxy.

1. Log in to the [Dashboard](https://client.falixnodes.net/).

2. Select a fallback server from your list of servers.

3. You will be redirected to the [Console Page](https://client.falixnodes.net/server/console) of your server. Hover over "Manage" on the top navigation bar, then navigate to the [File Manager](https://client.falixnodes.net/server/filemanager).

4. Open the `/config/` folder and edit the `paper-global.yml` file.

5. Scroll down to the `velocity:` section (line 111).

6. Change `enabled:` to `true`.

7. Insert the forwarding.secret key between the `''` of `secret:` (line 114).
> If you haven't saved the forwarding.secret key yet, go back to step 18 of configuring the proxy.

8. Save the file and return to the [File Manager](https://client.falixnodes.net/server/filemanager).

9. Open the `server.properties` file.

10. Change `online mode' to `false' (line 38).


11. Save the file and restart the server.

> Repeat this process for each fallback server you want.

## Velocity Commands
A list of Velocity commands can be found [here](https://docs.papermc.io/velocity/built-in-commands).

### In Game
Players, including you (of course), can easily teleport to the other servers on your network by using the `/server` command in game. They can then use their cursor to click on the server they want to go to. You can also do `/server <name>', like `/server lobby'.

This command requires the `velocity.command.server` permission, which is granted to everyone by default.
