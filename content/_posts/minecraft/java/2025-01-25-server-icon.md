The server icon is a great way to customize your server with a unique icon visible in the multiplayer server list. Not only will it help grab players' attention, but it will also make your server stand out.

Due to limitations icons must be in the `.png` format, on the bright side however, transparent backgrounds are supported. To avoid stretched or distorted icons we recommend using a square image as it will automatically be resized to 64\*64 pixels when uploaded.

1. Log in to the [Dashboard](https://client.falixnodes.net/).

2. Choose a server within your server list.

3. You will be redirected to your server's [Console page](https://client.falixnodes.net/server/console). In the top navigation bar, hover over "Server" then navigate to [Server Properties](https://client.falixnodes.net/server/properties).

4. At the top of the properties list, click on "**Add Server Icon**{: .blue }".

5. Click on "**Choose File**" and select your server icon.

6. Click on the "**Upload**{: .blue }" button to add your icon to the server.

7. (Re)start your server to apply your changes.

> The MOTD can be verified in the multiplayer server list. If your icon correctly appears, then you have successfully added it!
