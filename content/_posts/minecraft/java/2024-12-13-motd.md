A Minecraft server's message of the day (MOTD) is the brief description that appears below the server name in the multiplayer server list. It can be customized with colors and formatting to provide information or attract players' attention. The MOTD sets the tone for your server and gives players a quick idea of what to expect.

1. Log in to the [Dashboard](https://client.falixnodes.net/).

2. Within your server list, choose a server.

3. You will be redirected to the [Console Page](https://client.falixnodes.net/server/console) of your server. In the navigation menu, open the "Console & Files" category and navigate to [File Manager](https://client.falixnodes.net/server/filemanager).

4. At the top of the properties list, click on "**Edit Server MOTD**{: .blue }".

5. Type your MOTD within the given field, you may use the styling options provided to customise the message to your liking.

6. Check the preview and make sure the MOTD looks correct, then click on "**Save MOTD**{: .blue }" to save your changes.

7. (Re)start your server to apply the changes.

> The MOTD can be verified in the multiplayer server list. If your MOTD correctly appears, then you have successfully added it!
