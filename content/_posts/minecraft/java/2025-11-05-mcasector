## What happens when you use this?
Chucks that have been loaded for less than a few minutes are usually only loaded for players travelling through them, but they still take up a lot of space in your world.

Delting these chucks will
- Save up to 90% of your world size
- not delete important chucks

3. At the top, hover over "filter" and select "filter chunks".

> Setting this to more than 2 minutes can cause a destructive selection for a small gain and should only be selected if you know what you are doing.
