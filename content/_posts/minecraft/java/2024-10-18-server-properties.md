Understanding the [server.properties](https://server.properties) file is crucial for configuring and customizing your Minecraft server. This guide highlights the essential attributes within the file, enabling you to optimize and alter your server settings for the best gameplay experience.

## Accessing & Configuring server.properties

There are two possible methods to access server.properties, you may either directly alter the file found in the [File Manager](https://client.falixnodes.net/server/filemanager?dir=/), or using our server.properties editor:

1. Log in to the [Dashboard](https://client.falixnodes.net/).

2. Choose a server within your server list.

3. You will be redirected to your server's [Console page](https://client.falixnodes.net/server/console). On the top navigation bar, hover over "Server" then click on [Server Properties](https://client.falixnodes.net/server/properties).

To edit a setting, depending on the type, you may have to select an option from the given dropdown or type in a string of values. Settings that only accept a `true` or `false` value are referred to as booleans, while settings that require a typed value are called strings. In boolean settings, `true` signifies enabled while `false` signifies disabled.

To save your changes, simply click on "**Submit**{: .blue }" at the top of the properties list.

### Configurations:

**accepts-transfers**

Possible Values: Boolean
Default Value: `false`

This setting determines if the server accepts player transfers from other servers in a network.
It's often used in server networks to facilitate smooth transitions between different server instances using the `/transfer` command.

---

**allow-flight**

Possible Values: Boolean
Default Value: `false`

This option determines whether or not the server checks if players are flying. It's useful for servers with plugins that don't override this check and allow flight in Survival mode.

> Most cheat clients bypass this check easily, making it essentially useless and making trouble with false positives. If you want to protect from hackers, you should use an Anti Cheat.

---

**allow-nether**

Possible Values: Boolean
Default Value: `true`

This setting controls whether players can travel to the Nether dimension. Disabling it prevents players from accessing the Nether, which can be useful for servers with specific gameplay rules.

---

**broadcast-console-to-ops**

Possible Values: Boolean
Default Value: `true`

This property controls whether console command outputs are shown to online operators.

---

**broadcast-rcon-to-ops**

Possible Values: Boolean
Default Value: `true`

This property controls whether RCON command outputs are shown to online operators.

---

**bug-report-link**

Possible Values: URL
Default Value: ` `

A URL where players are able to report bugs and issues in the server. This can be accessed within the client's menu by navigating to "Server Links..." and then "Report Server Bug". Players will then be prompted with a warning message with the URL of the website provided.

---

**debug**

Possible Values: Boolean
Default Value: `false`

Enabling this option will cause the server to display additional information relating to its inner functions and processes in the console. As is clear from it's name, it is very useful for server owner's looking to fix bugs and other issues in their server.

---

**difficulty**

Possible Values: `peaceful`, `easy`, `normal`, `hard`
Default Value: `easy`

This setting defines the difficulty level of the server, affecting mob behavior and player damage.

-   If set to `peaceful`, no hostile mobs will spawn and health regenerates quickly.
-   If set to `easy`, hostile mobs will spawn but deal less damage compared to `normal`. Hunger depletes slowly.
-   If set to `normal`, mobs will deal average damage. Some additional behavior is enabled (eg. vindicators can break doors).
-   If set to `hard`, hostile mobs will deal more damage, hunger will deplete faster, and additional behavior is enabled, including the changes from `normal`.

---

**enable-command-block**

Possible Values: Boolean
Default Value: `false`

Possible Values: Boolean
Default Value: `false`

**enforce-whitelist**

Possible Values: Boolean
Default Value: `false`

Enabling this setting ensures that only players listed in the whitelist can join the server, providing control over the players you want to join. This is ideal for private or community servers that limit access to certain players.

---

**entity-broadcast-range-percentage**

Possible Values: Between `10` to `1000` percent
