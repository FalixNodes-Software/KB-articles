# What is Velocity?
[Velocity](https://papermc.io/software/velocity) is a Minecraft proxy designed to seamlessly connect multiple servers, allowing players to navigate between them without leaving the game.  

## Creating and Configuring the Proxy

1. Log in to the [Dashboard](https://client.falixnodes.net/).

2. Choose a server from your server list.

3. Go to the [Versions](https://client.falixnodes.net/server/versions) page, select and install Velocity.

4. Launch your server.

5. Click Stop, then click Kill.

6. Navigate to the [File Manager](https://client.falixnodes.net/server/filemanager).

7. Open `velocity.toml`.

8. Find `bind` and change the value after `:` to your server's port. You can find your server's port on the [Network page](https://client.falixnodes.net/server/network).

9. Find `player-info-forwarding-mode` and change it to:

    `modern` if all your servers are on version 1.13 or above;
  
    `legacy` if you have servers below version 1.13;
  
    `none` if you don't want to forward player info;
  
    You can read more about `player-info-forwarding-mode` [here](https://docs.papermc.io/velocity/player-information-forwarding).

10. Find the `[servers]` section.

11. Enter the server's address in the following format: `server-name = "IP:port"`

    Change `server-name` to the fallback server name (case-sensitive).
  
    Change `IP:port` to the IP and port of the fallback server. You can find it on the [Network page](https://client.falixnodes.net/server/network) of your fallback server.

    {: .note }
    > If you have multiple fallback servers, duplicate the above template and paste it under your first server.

12. Find `try = []` and enter the `server-name` of the server you want your players to join when they connect.

13. Scroll down to the `[forced-hosts]` section.

    > Forced Hosts is a way to have multiple subdomains automatically redirect to another server, overriding the default server we set in the previous step.

    If you are interested in using this feature, please follow [this guide](https://docs.papermc.io/velocity/configuration#forced-hosts-section) from Paper.

    If you aren't using this feature, delete all example values before the `[advanced]` section.

    > You can create multiple .falixsrv.me subdomains on the [Subdomains](https://client.falixnodes.net/server/subdomains) page.

14. Save the file and go back to the [File Manager](https://client.falixnodes.net/server/filemanager).

15. Open the `forwarding.secret` file.

16. Copy the contents of the file and save them for later. This is the password your proxies will use for communicating with each other.

17. Go back to the [Console](https://client.falixnodes.net/server/console) and restart your proxy server.

## Preparing a fallback server

{% tabs fallback %}

4. Set `enabled` to `true`.

5. Insert the key from `forwarding.secret` between `''` in the `secret:` parameter.

    > You can find the key in the `forwarding.secret` file on your Velocity proxy server.

6. Save the file and return to the [File Manager](https://client.falixnodes.net/server/filemanager).

7. Go back to the root directory and open the `server.properties` file.

8. Change `online-mode` to `false`.
