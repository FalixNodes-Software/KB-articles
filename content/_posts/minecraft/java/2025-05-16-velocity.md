## What is Velocity?
[Velocity](https://papermc.io/software/velocity) is a Minecraft proxy designed to seamlessly connect multiple servers, allowing players to navigate between them without leaving the game.  

{: .warning }
> Proxy servers are not available for the free plan.

## Creating and Configuring the Proxy

1. Log in to the [Dashboard](https://client.falixnodes.net/).

2. Choose a server from your server list.

3. Go to the [Versions](https://client.falixnodes.net/server/versions) page, select and install Velocity.

4. Launch your server.

5. Click Stop, then click Kill.

6. Navigate to the [File Manager](https://client.falixnodes.net/server/filemanager).

7. Open `velocity.toml`.

8. Find `bind` and change the value after `:` to your server's port. You can find them on the [Network](https://client.falixnodes.net/server/network) page.

9. Find `player-info-forwarding-mode` and change it to:

    `modern` if all your servers are on 1.13 or above;
	
    `legacy` if you have servers below 1.13;
	
    `none`  if you don't want to forward player info;
	
    You can read more about `player-info-forwarding-mode` [here](https://docs.papermc.io/velocity/player-information-forwarding).

10. Find the `[servers]` section.

11. Enter the server's address in the following format: `server-name = "IP:port"`

    Change `server-name` to the fallback server name (case sensitive).
	
    Change `IP:port` to the dynamic address of the fallback server. You can find it by pressing Connect in the [Console](https://client.falixnodes.net/server/console).

    {: .note }
    > If you have multiple fallback servers, duplicate the above code and paste it under your first server.

12. Find `try = []` and enter the `server-name` of the server you want your players to join when they connect.

13. Scroll down to the `[forced-hosts]` section.

    > Forced Hosts are a way to have multiple servers automatically redirect to another server, overriding the default server we set in the previous step.

    If you are interested in using this feature, please follow [this guide](https://docs.papermc.io/velocity/configuration#forced-hosts-section) from Paper.

    If you aren't interested in this feature, just delete all examples (until you get to the `[advanced]` section).

    > You can create multiple .falixsrv.me subdomains on the [Subdomains](https://client.falixnodes.net/server/subdomains) page.

14. Save the file and go back to the [File Manager](https://client.falixnodes.net/server/filemanager).

15. Open the `forwarding.secret` file.

16. Copy the contents of the file and save it for later. This is the password your proxies will use for communicating with each other.

17. Go back to the [Console](https://client.falixnodes.net/server/console) and restart the server.

## Preparing a fallback server
{% tabs fallback %}

{% tab fallback paper/purpur %}

1. In the Dashboard, select the server that will be used for connections via the proxy.

2. Navigate to the [File Manager](https://client.falixnodes.net/server/filemanager).

3. Open the `config` folder and open the `paper-global.yml` file.

4. Go to the `velocity` section.

5. Set `enabled` to `true`.

6. Insert the key from `forwarding.secret` between `''` in the `secret:` parameter.

    > You can find the key in the `forwarding.secret` file on your Velocity server.

7. Save the file and return to the [File Manager](https://client.falixnodes.net/server/filemanager).

8. Go back to the main directory and open the `server.properties` file.

9. Change `online-mode` to `false`.

10. Save the file and restart the server.
{% endtab %}

{% tab fallback fabric %}

1. Install the [fabricproxy-lite](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabricproxy-lite) mod on the server like explained in our [adding mods guide](https://kb.falixnodes.net/minecraft/modifications/general/adding-mods).

2. Start the server to generate the config file.

3. Navigate to the [File Manager](https://client.falixnodes.net/server/filemanager).

4. Open the `config` folder and open the `FabricProxy-Lite.toml` file.

5. Insert the key from `forwarding.secret` between `""` in the `secret =` parameter.

    > You will have to Enable `hackEarlySend` if LuckPerms is installed.

6. Save the file and Start the server.

7. Go back to the main directory and open the `server.properties` file.

8. Change `online-mode` to `false`.

9. Save the file and restart the server.
{% endtab %}

{% tab fallback forge %}

1. Install the [fabricproxy-lite](https://modrinth.com/mod/proxy-compatible-forge?version=1.21.4&loader=forge) mod on the server like explained in our [adding mods guide](https://kb.falixnodes.net/minecraft/modifications/general/adding-mods).

### Velocity Commands

A list of Velocity commands can be found [here](https://docs.papermc.io/velocity/built-in-commands).

### Switching Between Servers In-Game
Players can easily switch to other servers on the proxy network by using the `/server` command in-game.

This command requires the `velocity.command.server` permission, which is granted to everyone by default.
