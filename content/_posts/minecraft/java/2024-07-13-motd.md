## Introduction

A Minecraft server's message of the day (MOTD) is the brief description that appears below the server name in the multiplayer server list. It can be customized with colors and formatting to provide information or attract players' attention. The MOTD sets the tone for your server and gives players a quick idea of what to expect.

## Adding the MOTD to Your Minecraft Server

### Generating a MOTD

There are a wide range of MOTD generators available online, but in this example, we will be using [MCTools' MOTD creator](https://mctools.org/motd-creator). Although it is possible to manually create a MOTD, a generator tremendously simplifies this task and is not as error-prone. If you still wish to create it manually, you may refer to the [Minecraft Wiki's formatting code guide](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Formatting_codes).

1. Go to and open the [MCTools' MOTD creator](https://mctools.org/motd-creator).

2. Type a MOTD within the given field and style it as you wish. The live preview will display how it should look like when viewed in Minecraft.

3. Once you are done, copy the MOTD depending on the server software you use. If you use a fork of one of the listed software, copy the MOTD that your software is forked from (e.g: Paper --> Spigot).

### Applying It to the Server

1. Log in to the [Dashboard](https://client.falixnodes.net/).

2. Scroll down and choose a server, then click on "Play".

3. You will be redirected to your server's [Console page](https://client.falixnodes.net/server/console). In the top navigation bar, hover over "Manage" then navigate to [Server Properties](https://client.falixnodes.net/server/properties).

4. Find and set `motd` to the MOTD you generated before.

5. To save your changes, click on "Submit" at the top of the properties list.

6. (Re)start your server.

> The MOTD can be verified in the multiplayer server list. If your MOTD correctly appears, then you have successfully added it!
