- [Namecheap](https://namecheap.com/)
- [GoDaddy](https://godaddy.com)
- [Bluehost](https://bluehost.com/domains)
- [Squarespace](https://domains.squarespace.com/)
- [Hover](https://www.hover.com/)

### Creating the Records

1. Open the dashboard of your domain registrar.

    > The layout may vary depending on your registrar. If you're unsure where to find things, contact their support team for assistance.

2. Navigate to the DNS menu. This menu may also be referred to as "Advanced DNS" or "Domain Records".

3. Create a new A-record.

4. Enter the following info:

**Record Type**:
`A-record`
> (Some registrars may set this automatically when you choose to add a new record.)

**Name** or **Host**:
- To use `mydomain.tld` as your server address, enter: `@`

If you want players to join using a subdomain (like `play.mydomain.tld` or `mc.mydomain.tld`), then add the subdomain as host (for example: `play`).

**Value**:
The IPv4 address of your server. This can be found on [the network page](https://client.falixnodes.net/server/network) of your server (Remove the port number and `:` from the end).

**TTL**:
Either leave this as `automatic` or enter `30 min`

5. Save the new record and create a new SRV-record.

6. Enter the following info:

**Record Type**:
`SRV-record`
Setting This value may not be necessary if you selected the record type when creating a new record.

**Service**: 
`_minecraft`

**Protocol**:
If you want people to join using `mydomain.tld`, then add: `_tcp`

If you want players to join using a subdomain (like `play.mydomain.tld` or `mc.mydomain.tld`), then add the subdomain at the end (for example: `_tcp.play`).

**Priority**:
`0`

**Weight**:
`5`

**Port**:
The 5 digit value at the end of the IPv4 address from [the network page](https://client.falixnodes.net/server/network), do not enter the `:`.

**Target**:
The domain you want players to use when they join, for example `play.mydomain.tld`.

**TTL**:
Either leave this as `automatic` or enter `30 min`.

7. Save the new record,
