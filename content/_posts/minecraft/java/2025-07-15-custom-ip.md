There are a lot of places where you can register a domain. Here are a few popular ones:

[Namecheap](https://namecheap.com/)
[GoDaddy](https://godaddy.com)
[bluehost](https://bluehost.com/domains)
[Squarespace](https://domains.squarespace.com/)
[Hover](https://www.hover.com/)

### Creating the Records

1. Open the dashboard/site of your domain registrar.

    > The dashboard might look different depending on the registrar, if you need any help navigating then please contact the registrars support team.

2. Navigate to the "DNS" menu, this might also be referred to as "advanced DNS" or "domain records".

3. Create a new record, if possible choose "A record"

4. Enter the following info:

**Record Type**:
`A-record`
this value might not be needed if you already selected the record type when creating a new record

**Name** or **host**:
If you want players to join on `mydomain.tld` then add: `@`

If you want players to join on a subdomain (like `play.mydomain.tld` or `mc.mydomain.tld`) then add the subdomain as host (for example: `play`)

**Value**
The IPv4 of your server, this can be found in [the network page](https://client.falixnodes.net/server/network) of your server (remove your port (the :xxxxx at the end))

**TTL**
Either leave this as `automatic` or enter `30 min`

5. Save the new record and create a new SRV-record.

6. Enter the following info:

**Record Type**:
`SRV-record`
this value might not be needed if you already selected the record type when creating a new record

**Service**: 
`_minecraft`

**Protocol**:
If you want people to join on `mydomain.tld` then add: `_tcp`

If you want players to join on a subdomain (like `play.mydomain.tld` or `mc.mydomain.tld`) then add the subdomain at the end (for example: `_tcp.play`)

**Priority**:
`0`

**Weight**:
`5`

**port**:
The 5 digit value at the end of the IP from [the network page](https://client.falixnodes.net/server/network), do not enter the `:`

**Target**:
the domain you want players to join on.

**TTL**:
Either leave this as `automatic` or enter `30 min`
