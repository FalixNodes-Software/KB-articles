## :earth_asia: What Is Dynmap?

Dynmap is a plugin that allows you to see a live view of all your worlds, players and chats in your browser. It is very customizable as it is able to render your world using different renderers; however, it can be very resource-intensive depending on how it is set up.

## :hammer_and_wrench: Installation and Configuration:

### Prerequisites:

-   Ensure your server is running with Spigot or any of its forks (Paper, Purpur, etc).
-   Your server must have at least one **unused** extra port or in other words, a forwarded port. If you wish to allocate an extra port, please follow our [extra ports](/falix/dashboard/server/extra-port) guide.

### Installation:

We already have a guide on how to install Dynmap as well as any other plugin in our [Adding Plugins](/minecraft/modifications/general/adding-plugins) guide.

### Configuring Dynmap:

1. Once again, navigate back to the [File Manager](https://client.falixnodes.net/server/filemanager) by hovering over "Manage", then clicking on "File Manager".

2. Once more, open the [Plugins](https://client.falixnodes.net/server/filemanager?dir=/plugins/) folder.

3. Locate and open the [dynmap](https://client.falixnodes.net/server/filemanager?dir=/plugins/dynmap/) configuration folder.

4. Find and open "configuration.txt". This is the main configuration file where you will be able to customize any feature needed.

5. Scroll down and look for the `webserver-port: 8123` setting. Then set `8123` to your server's **unused** extra port. This will be the port your web-server will be hosted on, allowing you to access it through a browser.

    > If you require assistance creating or finding your extra ports, refer to our [extra ports](/falix/dashboard/server/extra-port) guide.

    > We recommend setting the `deftemplatesuffix` setting to `vlowres` or `lowres`. This ensures your world map does not consume a large amount of disk space and resources.

6. Click on "**Save File**{: .green }" to save your changes.

7. (Re)start your server to apply the changes.

8. To access your world map; open a new tab in your browser then in the address bar, follow the format below:
    ```
    http://<server-address>:<extra-port>
    ```
    Replace `<server-address>` with your server's actual address or IP, then replace `<extra-port>` with the extra port allocated to Dynmap. Your final URL should resemble `http://xxxxx.falixsrv.me:xxxx`.

{: .warning }

> Make sure you are using `http://` and **not** `https://`.

> If you have not loaded any chunks, Dynmap may display a blank screen. To solve this, simply join your server.
