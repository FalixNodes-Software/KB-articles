## What Is Dynmap?

Dynmap is a server-side software that allows you to see a live view of all your worlds, players and chats in your browser. It is very customizable as it is able to render your world using different renderers; however, it can be very resource-intensive depending on how it is set up.

## Installation and Configuration:

### Prerequisites:

{% tabs softwareType %}
{% tab softwareType <i class="type-software plugin"></i> Plugin %}

-   Ensure your server is running with Spigot or any of its forks (Paper, Purpur, etc).
-   Your server must have at least one **unused** extra port or in other words, a forwarded port. If you wish to allocate an extra port, please follow our [extra ports](/falix/dashboard/server/extra-port) guide.

{% endtab %}
{% tab softwareType <i class="type-software mod"></i> Mod %}

-   Ensure your server is running with either Fabric or Forge or any of their forks (Quilt & NeoForge respectively).
-   Your server must have at least one **unused** extra port or in other words, a forwarded port. If you wish to allocate an extra port, please follow our [extra ports](/falix/dashboard/server/extra-port) guide.
-   If you use Fabric, ensure you download the [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) as it is needed as a dependency.

### Configuring Dynmap:

{% tabs softwareType %}
{% tab softwareType <i class="type-software plugin"></i> Plugin %}

1. Once again, open the "Console & Files" category and navigate to [File Manager](https://client.falixnodes.net/server/filemanager).

2. Once more, open the [Plugins](https://client.falixnodes.net/server/filemanager?dir=/plugins/) folder.

3. Locate and open the [dynmap](https://client.falixnodes.net/server/filemanager?dir=/plugins/dynmap/) configuration folder.

4. Find and open "configuration.txt". This is the main configuration file where you will be able to customize any feature needed.

5. Scroll down and look for the `webserver-port: 8123` setting. Then set `8123` to your server's **unused** extra port. This will be the port your web-server will be hosted on, allowing you to access it through a browser.

    > If you require assistance creating or finding your extra ports, refer to our [extra ports](/falix/dashboard/server/extra-port) guide.

    > We recommend setting the `deftemplatesuffix` setting to `vlowres` or `lowres`. This ensures your world map does not consume a large amount of disk space and resources.

6. Click on "**Save File**{: .green }" to save your changes.

7. (Re)start your server to apply the changes.

8. To access your world map; open a new tab in your browser then in the address bar, follow the format below:
    ```
    http://<server-address>:<extra-port>
    ```
    Replace `<server-address>` with your server's actual address or IP, then replace `<extra-port>` with the extra port allocated to Dynmap. Your final URL should resemble `http://xxxxx.falixsrv.me:xxxx`.

{: .warning }

> Make sure you are using `http://` and **not** `https://`.

> If you have not loaded any chunks, Dynmap may display a blank screen. To solve this, simply join your server.

1. Once again, open the "Console & Files" category and navigate to [File Manager](https://client.falixnodes.net/server/filemanager).

2. A new folder called [dynmap](https://client.falixnodes.net/server/filemanager?dir=/dynmap/) should have generated, open it.

3. Find and open "configuration.txt". This is the main configuration file where you will be able to customize any feature needed.

4. Scroll down and look for the `webserver-port: 8123` setting. Then set `8123` to your server's **unused** extra port. This will be the port your web-server will be hosted on, allowing you to access it through a browser.
