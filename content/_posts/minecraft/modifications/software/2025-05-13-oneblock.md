## What is OneBlock?

OneBlock is a unique Minecraft challenge where you start on a single floating block in the sky. Each time you break the block, a new one is created in its place, offering different materials, chests, and even mobs. This is done progressively, meaning you will get blocks and items as you progress. You will go through different levels each with new challenges and resources. The goal is to expand your island and collect resources. OneBlock offers a fun mix of survival, building, and adventure, making it a popular choice for both solo and multiplayer gameplay.

## Installation:
