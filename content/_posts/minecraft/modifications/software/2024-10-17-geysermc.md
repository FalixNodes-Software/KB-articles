## What Is Geysermc?

GeyserMC allows players using Minecraft Bedrock Edition to join Minecraft Java Edition servers, allowing for seamless cross-platform play between both editions of the game. This is achieved by translating data between the Bedrock client and the Java server by converting the packet data to a format Java understands, and vice versa. It comes in the form of a plugin, mod and even its own standalone server software.

## Installation and Configuration:

### Prerequisites:

{% tabs softwareType %}
{% tab softwareType <i class="type-software plugin"></i> Plugin %}

-   Ensure your server is running with Spigot or any of its forks (Paper, Purpur, etc).
-   Make sure your server runs the latest version of Minecraft. If you wish to use an older version please refer to the guide provided by the [GeyserMC wiki](https://geysermc.org/wiki/geyser/supported-versions/).
-   Players joining with Minecraft Bedrock Edition must be using a supported version, a list of which can be found in the [GeyserMC wiki](https://geysermc.org/wiki/geyser/supported-versions/).

{% endtab %}
{% tab softwareType <i class="type-software mod"></i> Mod %}

-   Ensure your server is running with either Fabric or NeoForge or any of their forks (Quilt for Fabric).
-   Make sure your server runs the latest version of Minecraft. If you wish to use an older version please refer to the guide provided by the [GeyserMC wiki](https://geysermc.org/wiki/geyser/supported-versions/).
-   Players joining with Minecraft Bedrock Edition must be using a supported version, a list of which can be found in the [GeyserMC wiki](https://geysermc.org/wiki/geyser/supported-versions/).
-   If you use Fabric, ensure you download the [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) as it is needed as a dependency.

### Installation:

{% tabs softwareType %}
{% tab softwareType <i class="type-software plugin"></i> Plugin %}

We already have a guide on how to install GeyserMC as well as any other plugin in our [Adding Plugins](/minecraft/modifications/general/adding-plugins) guide.

{% tab softwareType <i class="type-software mod"></i> Mod %}

We already have a guide on how to install GeyserMC as well as any other mod in our [Adding Mods](/minecraft/modifications/general/adding-mods) guide.

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Configuration:

{% tabs softwareType %}
{% tab softwareType <i class="type-software plugin"></i> Plugin %}

1. Once again, open the "Console & Files" category and navigate to [File Manager](https://client.falixnodes.net/server/filemanager).

2. Once more, open the [Plugins](https://client.falixnodes.net/server/filemanager?dir=/plugins/) folder.

3. Locate and open the [Geyser-Spigot](https://client.falixnodes.net/server/filemanager?dir=/plugins/Geyser-Spigot/) configuration folder.

4. Find and open "config.yml". This is the main configuration file where you will be able to customize any feature needed.

5. Scroll down and look for the `clone-remote-port: false` setting. Then set `false` to `true`. This will use the same port used by Java as the Bedrock port.

6. Scroll down further and set the `auth-type` setting to `online`, `offline` or `floodgate` depending on the desired behaviour. Each option has been explained in the table below:

    | Option      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
    | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `online`    | All Bedrock players will be prompted and must login with their Java accounts every time they join the server.                                                                                                                                                             |
    | `offline`   | Any and all Bedrock players can join even without a legitimate account.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
    | `floodgate` |  Recommended option as it allows legitimate Bedrock players to join the game through their Bedrock account. However this option requires another plugin called [floodgate](https://geysermc.org/download?project=floodgate) to be able to authenticate accounts properly. |

7. Click on "**Save File**{: .green }" to save your changes.

8. (Re)start your server to apply the changes.

1. Once again, navigate back to the [File Manager](https://client.falixnodes.net/server/filemanager) by hovering over "Manage", then clicking on "File Manager".

2. Locate and open the [config](https://client.falixnodes.net/server/filemanager?dir=/config/) folder.

3. A new folder called `Geyser-*` should have generated. This may look different depending on your server software. Open it to access the Geyser configuration files.

4. Find and open "config.yml". This is the main configuration file where you will be able to customize any feature needed.

5. Scroll down and look for the `clone-remote-port: false` setting. Then set `false` to `true`. This will use the same port used by Java as the Bedrock port.
