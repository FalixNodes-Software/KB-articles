### What is OneBlock?

OneBlock is a unique Minecraft game mode where you start on a single floating block in the sky. Each time you break the block, a new one is created in its place, offering different materials, chests, and even mobs. As you progress, you go through different stages, such as "Deep forest", "mine", and "Acacia & mushrooms", each with new challenges and resources. The goal is to expand your island and collect resources. OneBlock offers a fun mix of survival, building, and adventure, making it a popular choice for both solo and multiplayer gameplay.


## Installation:

## Requirements:

- Make sure your server is running Spigot or one of its forks (Paper, Purpur, etc).

### uploading an empty world.

Create an empty void world in singleplayer or download one from the internet (like this [Completly empty void](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/worlds/completly-empty-void) world) and upload it like explaind [here](https://kb.falixnodes.net/minecraft/java/general/world-management)

### Creating your first island

1. start and join your server

2. Go to the location where you want your first OneBlock to be.

3. To enable circle generation, run `/ob circlemode true`, otherwise all new islands will spawn in a straight line.

4. Run `/ob set` to spawn the first OneBlock.

> Use `/ob set 150` if you want your islands to spawn farther or closer to each other than the 100 block default. where 150 is the desired distance.
