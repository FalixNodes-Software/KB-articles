## What is OneBlock?

OneBlock is a unique Minecraft challenge where you start on a single floating block in the sky. Each time you break the block, a new one is created in its place, offering different materials, chests, and even mobs. This is done progressively, meaning you will get blocks and items as you progress. You will go through different levels each with new challenges and resources. The goal is to expand your island and collect resources. OneBlock offers a fun mix of survival, building, and adventure, making it a popular choice for both solo and multiplayer gameplay.

## Installation:

### Requirements:

Make sure your server is running Spigot or one of its forks (Paper, Purpur, etc).

### Installing the plugin
We already have a guide on how to install OneBlock as well as any other plugin in our [Adding Plugins](/minecraft/modifications/general/adding-plugins) guide.

### Uploading an empty world

Create an empty void world in single-player or download one from the internet (like this [completely empty void](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/worlds/completly-empty-void) world) and upload it as explained [here](https://kb.falixnodes.net/minecraft/java/general/world-management).

### Configuring the plugin

1. In the navigation menu, go to the “Console & Files” category and open the [File Manager](https://client.falixnodes.net/server/filemanager).

2. Navigate to the [Plugins](https://client.falixnodes.net/server/filemanager?dir=/plugins/) directory.

3. Find and open the [OneBlock](https://client.falixnodes.net/server/filemanager?dir=/plugins/oneblock/) plugin directory.

4. Open the `config.yml` file. This is the main configuration file where you can customize all available features.

Take a look at the options you have there. Some important options you might want to change are:
