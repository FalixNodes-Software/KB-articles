### What is OneBlock?

OneBlock is a unique Minecraft game mode where you start on a single floating block in the sky. Each time you break the block, a new one is created in its place, offering different materials, chests, and even mobs. As you progress, you go through different stages, such as "Deep forest", "mine", and "Acacia & mushrooms", each with new challenges and resources. The goal is to expand your island and collect resources. OneBlock offers a fun mix of survival, building, and adventure, making it a popular choice for both solo and multiplayer gameplay.


## Installation:

## Requirements:

- Make sure your server is running Spigot or one of its forks (Paper, Purpur, etc).

## Installation:

We already have a guide on how to install OneBlock as well as any other plugin in our [Adding Plugins](/minecraft/modifications/general/adding-plugins) guide.

### uploading an empty world.

Create an empty void world in singleplayer or download one from the internet (like this [Completly empty void](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/worlds/completly-empty-void) world) and upload it as explained [here](https://kb.falixnodes.net/minecraft/java/general/world-management).
