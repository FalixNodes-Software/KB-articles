Understanding the [server.properties](https://server.properties) file is crucial for configuring and customizing your Minecraft server. This guide highlights the essential attributes within the file, enabling you to optimize and alter your server settings for the best gameplay experience.

## :pencil2: Accessing & Configuring server.properties

There are two possible methods to access server.properties, you may either directly alter the file found in the [File Manager](https://client.falixnodes.net/server/filemanager?dir=/), or using our server.properties editor:

1. Log in to the [Dashboard](https://client.falixnodes.net/).

2. Choose a server within your server list.

3. You will be redirected to your server's [Console page](https://client.falixnodes.net/server/console). On the top navigation bar, hover over "Server" then click on [Server Properties](https://client.falixnodes.net/server/properties).

To edit a setting, depending on the type, you may have to select an option from the given dropdown or type in a string of values. Settings that only accept a `true` or `false` value are referred to as booleans, while settings that require a typed value are called strings. In boolean settings, `true` signifies enabled while `false` signifies disabled.

To save your changes, simply click on "Submit" at the top of the properties list.

-   If set to `normal`, mobs will deal average damage. Some additional behavior is enabled (eg. vindicators can break doors).
