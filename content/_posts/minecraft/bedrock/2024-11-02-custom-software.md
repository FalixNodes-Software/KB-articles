Before proceeding with this guide, we recommend reading our [server software guide](/minecraft/bedrock/general/server-software) to better understand the terms used below.

Users may often want to use other software not officially provided by Falix, either for their unique features, plugin support or cross-play capabilities. Fortunately this can be done by adding it as a custom core, as will further be explained in this article.

## Choosing the Server Software:

Before we can continue, you must choose a server core and download it. A list of the most commonly used Bedrock server software and their download websites are as follows:

-   [Official Bedrock Dedicated Server](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server/bedrock)
-   [PocketMine-MP (PMMP)](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP/releases)
-   [NukkitX](https://ci.opencollab.dev/job/NukkitX/job/Nukkit/job/master)

{: .warning }

> **NEVER** download shady or untrusted server software, or software from unofficial websites. Malicious developers can use them to easily gain backdoor access to your server and wreck havoc.

## Installing It on Your Server:

1. Download the Dedicated Server Software for Ubuntu **(Linux)** from the [Minecraft Bedrock website](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server/bedrock).
