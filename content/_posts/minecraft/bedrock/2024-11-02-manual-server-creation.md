Before proceeding with this guide, we recommend reading our [server software guide](/minecraft/java/general/server-software) to better understand the terms used below.

For Minecraft Bedrock Edition servers, several popular server software options offer unique features, plugin support, and cross-play capabilities.

Bedrock softwares are standalone and can be often downloaded directly. Hereâ€™s a rundown of the most commonly used Bedrock server software and their download websites:
