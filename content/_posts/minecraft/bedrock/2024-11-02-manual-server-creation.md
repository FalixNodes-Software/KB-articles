Before proceeding with this guide, we recommend reading our [server software guide](/minecraft/java/general/server-software) to better understand the terms used below.

For Minecraft Bedrock Edition servers, several popular server software options offer unique features, plugin support, and cross-play capabilities.

## :cook: Preparing the Server Software:

Bedrock softwares are standalone and can be often downloaded directly. Hereâ€™s a rundown of the most commonly used Bedrock server software and their download websites:

{: .warning }

> **NEVER** download shady or untrusted server software, or software from unofficial websites. Malicious developers can use them to easily gain backdoor access to your server and reck havoc.

-   [Official Bedrock Dedicated Server](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server/bedrock)
-   [PocketMine-MP](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP/releases)
